I said don't get complacent and now here you are.</p>
<h1 id="runs">Runs</h1>
<ul>
<li>Wildwood end-to-end</li>
<li>St. Helens</li>
<li>Dog Mountain laps</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="tangibles">Tangibles</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Get a data plan. Get mobile.</li>
<li>Pay off all your debt. Taxes, medical, credit card, next year's taxes.</li>
<li>Get a new car. Something with utility that you can sleep in.</li>
<li>Buy the gear you actually need, stop just scraping by with what you think you can deal with</li>
<li>Track, obviously.</li>
<li>I want to do adventures. I want to go places. I want to see things, despite how I feel day-to-day this is real. Even if I don't think I want to go, I do. I will appreciate these things.</li>
<li>Packraft more places. Get more comfortable and better. Maybe try a hardshell sometime.</li>
<li>Do you really want to be doing web dev for the rest of your life? Can you? Are you just going to burn yourself out again?</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="intangibles">Intangibles</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Stay challenged. Challenge yourself. Find a mentor or something. When was the last time you learned something?</li>
<li>Get excited. Don't get complacent. Stay away from social media.</li>
<li>Read.</li>
<li>The nihilism isn't funny anymore. Be supportive. Be verbal. Be helpful. Do good. Make other people laugh. Say the things you're thinking.</li>
</ol>
<p>I've had a lot of feelings lately, good and bad, and I wanted to write this. I needed a good kick in the teeth, and I definitely got it. Sure, the broken arm sucks, but all that did was show a lot of underlying issues that have been simmering for a while.</p>
<p>You're right in that we do have different backgrounds, and we're drawn to different people. I feel that, but theres a reason I like doing things with you and being challenged by you. We share a common desire to <em>do</em>, to experience more no matter what, to see things and feel them. The last thing I want is to be stuck, cold and unfeeling and uncaring. Distracted and muddling around in the same puddle for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>I <em>do</em> dream, I do think about the future, about what I want and how to achieve it. I've already done things I would never have thought about before I met you.</p>
<p>Im sorry I didn't say anything on your birthday, that I was in such an empty mood christmas morning. I regret not texting you when your race was over. I regret not answering your phone call the night before Bend. I regret not being present in all those times I wasn't, or that I scoff at your ideas when you're obviously excited about them. I'm sorry that I never seem to make any progress, that I shrug you off when I obviously need something but can't be bothered to care about it. I'm sorry I told you I felt like I should be able to walk away from anything in my life at a moment's notice.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I'm not always excited even when I have every right to be, that I'm not the person you want to bounce ideas off of and spitball and dream with.</p>
<p>I like your energy. It reminds me that not everything is dark and do-or-die and Dr. Doom. It's important for me to see that, and to believe in it. I miss talking with you.</p>
<p>That's all. Q</p>
