<h1 id="day-5">Day 5</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_5_1.jpg"></img></p>
<p>I think day five is really when we reached peak injury but also kind of found our groove: I was starting to get tendonitis in both of my achilles tendons, the shitty grips I had purchased were really starting to hurt my hands, and Megan’s lower lip had swollen up like a balloon due to bad sunburn. The high elevation sun was pretty brutal. We were better about sunscreen/sleeves/protection after that. On the flipside, I felt like we were really in it and had adapted to the daily rhythm of food, ride, camp.</p>
<p>After a cold night of sleep, the sun hit us and we were able to make it out of camp after lingering for just a little bit. We had a nice, morning-chill ride to At-Bashy, maybe 10 miles or so. I went without socks and it felt nice. After airing down the tires just a little bit, even the washboard didn’t phase me. It was a very pleasant morning.</p>
<p>In At-Bashy we took our time and just ate a bunch of things. We had our first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manti_(food)">Manti</a>, which were full of fat and amazing, then some more at a small restaurant, and I was cornered by a random group of locals and had some more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumis">Kumis</a> from a bucket in a shipping container. The rest of the morning was kind of giggly.</p>
<p>The day was mostly spent slogging in the sun uphill. We were on dirt for a good few hours, before skipping the turn to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tash_Rabat">Tash Rabat</a> and just getting on the highway. It was the weirdest, longest climb of my life: One perfectly straight, uphill road forever. I was lost in thought (and Neuromancer) when I looked up and Megan was gone, looking around I saw that she’d gone to what appeared to be a closed, log-cabin cafe.</p>
<p>A woman came out and offered us some coke, which turned into food, which was very nice. We had a good unexpected time there. The hostess was very friendly and we were able to chat just a little bit and enjoy some bread, dumpling-like things full of mutton and oil, and some coca-cola. It was very welcome.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_5_2.jpg"></img></p>
<p>From there we continued up, again, until we finally crested the hill and found our turn-off up into the pass we were supposed to go to. We randomly ran into a <a href="https://www.silkroadmountainrace.cc/">Silk Road Mountain Race</a> driving back from somehwere, but we didn’t get to chat much. We continued on.</p>
<p>A stream we were depending on wasn’t flowing, so we turned around and dropped 2000 feet back to the valley floor for water and camped. The campsite was very pretty but smelled kind of like cow poop- common around here but funny. We’d get wafts of it all night through the tent wall. Dinner was some poorly cooked egg noodles and lentils- any food is great when you’re super hungry but it wasn’t our best culinary moment.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_5_3.jpg"></img></p>
<p>We ended up doing sixty miles, a few of which we’d have to repeat the following morning.</p>
<h1 id="day-6">Day 6</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_6_1.jpg"></img></p>
<p>Day 6 was a trial- it was cold in the night so M didn’t sleep well in her quilt and I didn’t fare that much better in my battered old sleeping bag. There was some frost outside when we woke up. I’d forgotten to put the fuel canister in my sleeping bag, so I had to stick it in my shirt for thirty minutes or so in the morning just to get it hot enough to work. It took us about two hours to leave camp, pretty average for us.</p>
<p>It took us about 45 minutes to get back to our highpoint from the previous day, which was nice. From there we should have just turned around again and gotten on the road that goes through the pass, because the route traverses up game trails to basically the same point. It took us forever. Most of the time we couldn’t ride because the singletrack was too deep and narrow (“It’s like bumper cars” - M) or there was just no track at all. Lots of hike-a-bike. At least the view from the top was pretty.</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy to get back to the road, either: We had to drop down into a ravine and then push our bikes up the other side. Very steep cow trails. I wanted to do the whole adventure for some reason but M had suggested the road. We should’ve done the road: The view was the same and you could actually ride. Ain’t no brutality like meaningless brutality.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_6_2.jpg"></img></p>
<p>After some riding around on the valley floor through some sandstone formations and looking at the increasingly ugly weather behind us, we began the long climb up MELS pass. The rain hit us pretty much as it was getting hard. It was an amazing climb: We’d turn a corner thinking we were near the top and we would just see more switchbacks climbing up the pass at increasing angles. It was amazing. I called a particularly rough section the “mindbender”.</p>
<p>The sun poked out just as we got to the top, in time for some pictures, before coming right back. We had a very amazing descent through granite formations, past a few yurts, and then dropped into the best views on the trip: Forever in all directions, an amazing gorge and rock formations. It was like we’d dropped off the edge of the earth into some otherworldly place. Pictures don’t do it justice but every new turn was breathtaking.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_6_3.jpg"></img></p>
<p>After dropping 5000 feet and stopping to check out a small, ruined graveyard, we made it to Baetov: My left achilles was rapidly dteriorating so it was nice to arrive at our destination. We ate at a place named “Big Burger” that didn’t have any burgers, and then found lodging at a guesthouse just named “Desperation”. It was very coldwar era. We managed to top-up on supplies, too, mostly with candy, peanuts and weird little wafers.</p>
<p>We felt lucky to be in a guesthouse that night, becase a thunderstorm rolled in just as it was getting dark. They also made us a second dinner, which was great.</p>
<h1 id="day-7">Day 7</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_7_1.jpg"></img></p>
<p>We slept pretty well in the desperation guesthouse. They were accomodating and made breakfast for us at around 6:30AM and we were off into the sun after packing our groceries. Mine was mostly peanuts. It was an easy 20 miles where we stopped at a cute little place called the Nomad’s Valley Shop- they were in the middle of renovating but opened up for us and we had lunch. We even had a good spot to charge, and real coffee at the end. It was magical.</p>
<p>The kids outside kept comparing our tire sizes.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_7_2.jpg"></img></p>
<p>We headed up a gravel road later and it just kept going straight up- another pass. We climbed for a bit and then grabbed water just before it got real steep. A family was there and they kept feeding us berries. They were kind of bitter and acidic but not bad.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_7_3.jpg"></img></p>
<p>It of course rained on us as we climbed the pass, and all-told took us about seven hours from the Nomad’s cafe to the top of the pass. We pressed on as it got dark and wet and cold towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_Kol_Lake">Song-kul</a> where we stayed at a yurt camp for the night. It was good to be inside and for another night, and to have some hot food.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_7_4.jpg"></img></p>
<h1 id="day-8">Day 8</h1>
<!-- Actually day 8 -->
<p><img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_7_5.jpg"></img></p>
<p>I slept extremely well and then we had a great breakfast. Little thin crepes. We packed up soon after and were headed out, kind of following the west edge of the lake. The trail was basically just grass, though. Sometimes it was a game trail, sometimes it was gravel, sometimes nothing. It took a long time to go ~15 miles or whatever to the next pass.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_8_1.jpg"></img></p>
<p>We descended way down from the pass into a small village where we had lunch- it was very animated and a duo of old men kept trying to talk with us. I’m not really sure what we said or what they were asking but it was entertaining for all.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_8_2.jpg"></img></p>
<p>We did a lot of pedaling on flat dirt roads, with some pavement, getting blasted by construction trucks the whole time. It was kind of an arduous journey towards Chaek. We found a random, small restaurant on the side of the road and huddled in just in time to hide from some thunderstorms that rolled in. It was really nice.</p>
<p>We stayed there almost until dark, then struggled to find a campsite a little ways down. This was the point in the trip where I started getting chased by random dogs. We eventually pitched the tent just a little ways off the main road, behind a small bend. Our first attempt found us at the foot of some small lake made completely of tar, which was really creepy in the dark, so we just turned back and found what we could. We did 60+ miles, mostly downhill, which was great for morale.</p>
