<h1 id="accomplishments">Accomplishments</h1>
<p>Where do I even start? I’m tired just thinking about it.</p>
<h3 id="general">General</h3>
<ul>
<li>One big thing I’ve started doing is that on every trip we go on now,
I started a “Lessons for X 20YY”, and just write down everything I
learned, experienced or want to look up. I end up with great quotes,
bookes to read, lessons that are invaluable, etc. They all go in one
place and they’re really easy to look back on.</li>
<li>My guitar playing is getting there. It’s such a fun, productive
activity. A little bit every day with no plan is more than enough to
really make me feel like I’m investing in it.</li>
<li>Started logging all/most of my transactions. I started out using an
app on our trip, which carried over to home life, which eventually has
led to <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/">YNAB</a> which I’m
still getting used to.</li>
<li>Got two jobs.</li>
<li>Didn’t have enough money to pay taxes when we got back from Asia so
I had to go on an installment plan. That sucked. You owe WAY more when
thats over.</li>
<li>I sewed a bit- a couple bike bags, mostly.</li>
<li>Learned a lot about communication and what works well for me and
having emotionally heavy conversations.</li>
<li>My <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3NWF0-Fmpl/">car was
stolen.</a></li>
<li>We did the <a
href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzVysz0lN8L/">Gambler 500</a>
again.</li>
<li>Visited Grandma!</li>
<li>Went to Kentucky for like, a day.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="racingbikes">Racing/Bikes</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzJGB3iFQAy/">Repainted my
track bike</a> in Dazzle camo.</li>
<li>Had a <a
href="http://q.pfiffer.org/posts/2019-05-12-Emerald_Outback_2019">TERRIBL(y
great) TIME</a> at the Oregon Emerald Outback. The mental toughness that
I acquired coming out of that trip was amazing. I didn’t care about
physical pain, or cold, or being hungry, or too hot or sweaty or
dehydrated- it was all fine.</li>
<li>Did <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2272744480">white rim
in a day.</a></li>
<li>Had my <a
href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2353171792">biggest single
push</a> ever, at 160 miles.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B2P6CqOl5_L/">Red Bull Bay
Climb!</a> I qualified but that was it. Neat event.</li>
<li>Did my first Alpenrose Velodrome Challenge but it was a pretty bad
turnout and I hadn’t raced all season due to the fucked up arm. Kinda
sad.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="adventure">Adventure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ran my own solo <a
href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzCUF11F3XA/">50k around Mt.
St. Helens</a></li>
<li>Ran two ultramarathons, one was <a
href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B2EnNUalevW/">The RUT</a> and the
other was <a
href="https://gobeyondracing.com/races/lastest-not-fastest/">Lastest not
Fastest</a>. It was a monster year of foot racing, for some reason.</li>
<li>Did my first orienteering race (super fun, definitely want to do
more)</li>
<li>Two new sports: Skiing and Ice Climbing. I’m pretty stoked on ice
climbing I think.</li>
<li>My <a
href="http://q.pfiffer.org/posts/2019-08-29-Camping_plus_others_megamix">packing
lists</a> are getting really dialed in.</li>
<li>The summer was kind of a wash because I broke my arm.</li>
<li>Got PADI certified and went on 10 dives, 8 in Bali and 2 in the
Phillipines.</li>
<li>Did a solo <a
href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BvpKEygFpYS/">bikerafting</a>
adventure. That was hilariously bad, but amazing.</li>
<li>First ski tour, first ice climb, first hut-to-hut multi-day ski
tour: Winter sports abound.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="climbing">Climbing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Climbed sport in Tonsai (Thailand), Laos, Cat Ba (Vietnam), Hong
Kong and the Phillipines.</li>
<li>Redpointed my hardest climb ever in the Phillipines.</li>
<li>Learned how to <a
href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BwTbfe9FsPa/">crack climb in Indian
Creek</a>, and in Moab (Wall Street)</li>
<li>Climbed Mt. Hood</li>
<li>Climbed in the Gunks and the Adirondacks</li>
<li>Climbed in Red Rocks (Vegas)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="packrafting">Packrafting</h3>
<ul>
<li>Survived <a href="">Westwater Canyon</a> with just Megan - we
probably shouldn’t have done this. Way too dangerous with just the two
of us.</li>
<li>Did part of <a
href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2235734434">Hood River</a>
without swimming. Would have been COLD.</li>
<li>Had some scary swims at the <a
href="https://packraft.org/work/packraft-roundup/">American Packrafting
Roundup</a> where I <a
href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B0Pj9xqFhw7/">broke a paddle.</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="strengthfitness">Strength/Fitness</h3>
<ul>
<li>SO MUCH RUNNNING! I broke my arm and that was pretty much it. Tempo
runs, uphill workouts, mountain objectives, Mt. Defiance, Helens, Big
Sky, all sorts of stuff. The worst run of the year was definitely this
<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2552815575">Stack Rock
run</a> in the heat. I thought I was gonna pass out.</li>
<li>Definitely climbing better than I ever have, pre- and post-break.
I’m leading in the gym and led quite a bit outside in the beginning of
the year. Still now trad or ice yet.</li>
<li>There were a ton of big days, so I’m definitely an endurance athlete
now. My bodyweight is hovering around 150lbs. I’m not afraid of 12-14
hour pushes yet, still haven’t broken the 24 hour barrier but I imagine
that’ll be soon.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p>I think Gideon the Ninth was my book of the year- I couldn’t put it
down. Harry August was a close second. Also finally read Patrick
Rothfuss and couldn’t put any of his books down either. Not as great a
turn-out as last year.</p>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>
<p>Not a whole lot to speak of: A couple Oleg commits, some waifu stuff,
pdxburritoreview, my own resume, just random things. Some Voidcrash work
that I don’t want to talk about yet.</p>
<h1 id="side-projects">Side-Projects</h1>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://github.com/qpfiffer/pdxburritoreview.com">pdxburritoreview.com</a>
- Pretty much exactly what it sounds like.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="regrets">Regrets</h1>
<ul>
<li>I didn’t handle breaking my arm very well. I didn’t utilize the time
and I was just kind of in a funk for a month or two. It wasn’t
ideal.</li>
<li>I didn’t read as much as I wanted, surprise surprise.</li>
<li>Bad journalling year, except for the travel sections. I’m okay with
this right now since the documentation is good in other places, but it’s
nice to have a written account.</li>

<ul>
<li>STAY HYPE</li>
<li>Retry the bivy-a-month challenge
<ul>
<li>January: Wallowas, 1/31 - 2/1: Slept outside in a snow pit outside
the yurt.</li>
<li>February: 2/22 - 2/23: Slept outside at the smith rock state bivy
area. Fantastic night but the SOL emergency bivy was very damp. Ended up
just sleeping on top of it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Be more proactive about body maintenance: Stretching, Rolling, Yoga,
etc. I’m getting older and I need to mobility.</li>
<li>One book a month, at least. Read through all the stuff on the
shelf.</li>
<li>More Ice Climbing</li>
<li>Get better at skiing</li>
<li>Climb Rainier, Helens</li>
<li>Take more classes! First-aid, Crevasse rescue, Rock safety,
Swiftwater, etc. (This one is cheating because I already signed up to a
bunch of them)</li>
<li>Move every day.</li>
<li>Work on making new and varied friends: Human relationships are
valuable.</li>
<li>Cross some items off the BS Adventure calendar</li>
<li>Do one of <a
href="http://www.christofteuscher.com/aagaa/run-outside-the-box/">these

<li>Concussion went with the broken arm</li>
<li>Pulled spinal erector</li>
<li>Pulled groin muscle</li>
<li>Chronic sinusitis</li>
<li>Sick maybe 5-6 times?</li>
<li>Chronic hamstring issue from sprinting in Myanmar</li>
<li>Psoriasis from Asia, somehow.</li>
<li>Lastest not Fastest inflamed something in my foot so it was
impossible to run without pain for a few weeks</li>
<li>Pulled Quad after LnF, The Rut and the Red Bull Bay Climb</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a wrap! I’m sure more stuff will come up. I feel pretty stoked
in general so I’m not too stuck to defining objectives to finish. This
year is shaping up to be pretty involved anyway, so I’m not worried
about it.</p>
