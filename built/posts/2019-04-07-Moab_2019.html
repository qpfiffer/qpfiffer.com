Listened to a lot of the Calaphate podcast,
which is a pretty fascinating look at ISIS.</p>
<p>Day 1: Slept about three hours outside of Moab, outside of SLC. Got
into Moab proper around 10:30 or so and had a proper breakfast at Love
Muffin, which has pretty good burritos but bad coffee. Stayed there for
a minute before heading over near the slick rock trail system. I had a
brief phone call with a contact at Triplebyte, then we went on a run. I
felt pretty solid and focused on turning my right foot so my IT band
stuff doesn’t act up.</p>
<p>Later met up with Megan’s friend Whitney and we climbed a few cracks
on Wall Street, right off Potash road. I got to break in the hastily
purchased TC Pros and untouched crack gloves. Cracks are monstrously
hard, but at least I get to toprope everything. My whole body is
tired.</p>
<p>We all went to a burrito place in the evening. Megan and Whitney went
inside and I attempted to prepare my bike for the 100 mile ride the day
afterward. Everything went on perfectly except I couldn’t get my flat
pedals off. Turns out I forgot a pedal wrench and I could just pliers
them off; oh well. Flat pedal death march it is.</p>
<p>Dinner was great but really hectic and crowded. We left and headed
out near Horsethief campground and prepped all of our stuff for the
following day. Water, snacks, tools, clothing, etc. Megan went with
around 4 liters of water and I went with about 5. Seems like it would
hopefully be enough. Really nice campspot, very quiet and much warmer
than day 0.</p>
<p>Day 2: White Rim in a day, 100 miles. Woke up sore and bruised in
weird places. Crack climbing! We got up at 5:00AM right on the dot (more
or less) and left the tent and got right on the road. I ate Megan’s
leftover burrito for breakfast and we headed over to Shafer Bottom (I
think) where we parked the car. We were riding by 6:40ish.</p>
<p>The first 20 miles passed pretty easily, but my new brakepads kept
squeaking and I hadn’t had any coffee so I was cranky and quiet. The
scenery was beautiful though, slow rolling hills and lots of high-desert
shrub stuff. We passed a few riders going the other direction.</p>
<p>We’d left a little later than we wanted to so we encountered the
entrance ranger, luckily he let us through even though we’d left out
money and passes in the car. Nice guy. The park from there was really
beautiful, you drop into Canyonlands proper and you’re right there among
all the huge walls and stones and massive towers. It was awesome as soon
as we got inside; I was definitely prepared to ride boring gravel roads
in shrub brush all day and this was a welcome change.</p>
<p>The rest of the day went about as fast as you’d expect when you’re
going to ride for twelve hours. We passed all sorts of bikers, even a
couple fatbikes and full bikepacking setups. We met a guy briefly
testing his Tour Divide setup, I got really excited talking to him. He
left early on and we never saw him again.</p>
<p>Around mile 50 or 60 or something I took a fall on a descent and
circumcised the end of my finger but was otherwise okay. It kind of put
a damper on my mood for an hour or so, but when you’re riding all day
you have a lot of hours so I was okay later.</p>
<p>After the halfway mark it was more or less downhill with some awful
punchy climbs you could see on the elevation profile from trail forks.
We kept dreading the second to last one, and it was pretty brutal. We
ended up pushing our bikes through really fine sand/dirt/dust for parts
of it, which isn’t really very fun after 80 or so miles of grinding.</p>
<p>We thought we were home free after that, but we descended back down
into the canyon. I thought we were just going to roll straight out, but
we had one final, awful climb back up to the car. We were grinding it
out for quite a ways, it looks like a GPS error on the elevation
profile. We were both really happy to be up and out and back at the
car.</p>
<p>We were sore and very dirty, but the golden hour was just starting
and it was raining a little bit, so the scenery was amazing. Rainbows
and glowing cliffs, it was awesome. We cleaned up a bit and limped
around and struggled to get the bikes on the car, and ate random food
and snacks.</p>
<p>We’d both brought pretty much the perfect amount of food and water,
so that was pretty nice. We both had just a little bit leftover, which
means we did good. After a short drive back to camp we made two massive
boxes of mac &amp; cheese before going to sleep. Very sore butts and
backs and arms were happy to lay in the tent again.</p>
<p>Day 3:</p>
<p>Slept in because we could, and the dirt century had left us kind of
beat up. It was amazing, and completely silent when we woke up. We
lingered a little bit and then packed up and left. The rain fly had been
really unnecessary, and was kind of wet from condensation.</p>
<p>Burritos and more lingering in town at Love Muffin again. It was good
to sit outside and journal and catch up on some stuff, upload rides, see
messages, that kind of thing. We slipped back into some old patterns
from Asia, a little bit.</p>
<p>We hung out for a bit and enjoyed our time, then washed the bikes
down the street. We were meeting up with Whitney to do some paddling, so
we got going around 12:30 or something, and after some car swapping and
logistics were headed out to the Onion Creek putin around 1:30 or
something.</p>
<p>The paddle was really fun, we went around nine miles and didn’t
encounter anytyhin over class I/II. I’d just put my backband and
thighstraps back in, and the boat felt really good, I tried to do more
edging and feeling the packraft out than I’ve done before. Whitney is
pretty good and it was fun to watch him surf stuff and play around in
eddy lines.</p>
<p>We met a friend of Megan’s who had taken her packrafting swiftwater
rescue course with her, and her boyfriend, and they tagged along on the
last stretch of the river. Whitney managed to roll my raft before we all
got out, pretty impressive. After shuttling, letting some stuff dry and
packing everything away we headed back into town for veggie burritos at
a place called Giliberto’s. From there we stopped briefly at City Market
to get supplies and firewood before heading to Indian Creek.</p>
<p>It was an hour or so drive, I think, in the dusk and we pulled into
the superbowl campsite when it was full dark. For some reason there are
a ton of these caterpillar/meal worm things that come out as soon as it
get’s dark. They’ll crawl all over your feet and they’re attracted to
light so you have to be careful. They’re everywhere! We packed up for
the following day of climbing, decided what to do and went to sleep.</p>
<p>Day 4:</p>
<p>We slept in again, which was great, and had a slow start. We got out
of the tent around eight and made breakfast, instant coffee and just sat
at the picnic table for a while. It was great. I tried to hydrate, we’ve
both got colds that don’t seem to be going away. I’m sure the slight
elevation and non-stop physical activity isn’t helping.</p>
<p>We piled into Whitney’s two door truck and headed out to our first
crag of Indian Creek, <a
href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105716880/donnelly-canyon">Donnelly
Canyon</a>. I proceded to get my ass kicked following cracks lead either
by Megan or Whitney. Although <a
href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105717328/generic-crack">Generic
Crack</a> was pretty fun and less of a struggle, but definitely a very
looooong route. It was right near the end of our 70 meter rope.</p>
<p>We ended the day near <a
href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105716883/battle-of-the-bulge-buttress">Battle
of the Bulge</a>. We climbed 4 routes or so total, and I flailed on a
couple and ended up pretty beat at the end of the day. Crack climbing is
really hard, I’ve never had the backs of my hands hurt like this before.
We also didn’t bring enough water and ended up running out towards the
end of the day.</p>
<p>Good Mac and Cheese evening, and in bed around 10:00.</p>
<p>Day 5:</p>
<p>Similar to day 4, we slept in a bit and had a nice, slow start to the
day. Drank instant coffee, ate instant oatmeal and bananas, that kind of
thing. Today we packed 3 liters of water for each of us, which we
figured would be more than enough.</p>
<p>Same story, hop in the small car and drive until my foot is asleep,
then hop out and scramble up to the wall. Our first climb was <a
href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105717922/wavy-gravy">Wavy
Gravy</a>, which was a really interesting, featured climb.</p>
<p>Megan was feeling spicy and put up <a
href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106035142/pop-quiz-aka-brown-on-butter">Brown
on Butter</a>, which I couldn’t get up. Ring locks, tiny feet and thin
hands is not something I feel like I can conquer right now.</p>
<p>It started getting windy towards the end of the day, and after a
botched attempt at the eponymous <a
href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105717484/scarface">Scarface</a>
itself, we climbed <a
href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105717763/trading-places">one
more route</a> and bailed.</p>
<p>Back in camp we enjoyed the rest of our firewood, and a random guy
came over and offered us his group’s camp chairs and a bunch of random
supplies. Megan and I had been talking about camp chairs the whole trip
so it was a bit of universal luck that someone just walked up and gave
them to us. Another of her friends came by and talked to us for a while
and offered us a bottle of wine, which we enjoyed near the fire. It’s a
bit easier to hide from the caterpillars when you can put your feet
up.</p>
<p>We went to bed around ten, but had to get up around 2AM to put the
rain fly on. We were lucky in that the rain started out pretty light and
easy, and we had time to put the fly on before it really started coming
down.</p>
<p>Day 6:</p>
<p>We got up around 7AM, as the rain had sort of stopped and Whitney was
heading out to fly back to Washington for a while.</p>
