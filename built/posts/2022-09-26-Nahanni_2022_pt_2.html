first.</a></p>
<p>This part of the trip is from day six through day twelve, our time in
the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirque_of_the_Unclimbables">cirque.</a></p>
<h1 id="day-6">Day 6</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/nahanni_2022/day_6_1.jpg"></img> <em>The crew
gets read to heft packs up to the fairy meadows. My giant static line in
the bottom left.</em></p>
<p>We had a semi-relaxed morning in camp and were more or less on our
way up to the cirque proper by 9:00AM. We took a good picture of all of
us standing in front of our comically large/heavy bags before heading
out, trying to hide from the mosquitoes before going into the woods. I’d
thought the load in the bag the day before was heavy, but with ~7 days
of food, climbing gear and a 100 meter static rope, the bag was REAL
BAD.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/nahanni_2022/day_6_2.jpg"></img> <em>Dirk
stands in front of Mt Harrison-Smith after we enter the Fairy
Meadows</em></p>
<p>We split into two groups and started making our way up the ~2500 feet
necessary to get to camp. The first couple of miles were fine, and Dirk
managed to find some edible mushrooms for dinner, but the trail soon
became steep and exhausting. Every time we stopped we were swarmed by
mosquitoes. We took a break just before the trail got really steep and I
begrudgingly got out the trekking poles. They helped a lot.</p>
<p>After a few hours of slogging, sweating, stumbling and general
misery, we made it to the top. We were all a little confused, since
every single trip report we’d read mentioned that the traverse along the
scree slope under Mt. Harrison-Smith was the worst part of the approach,
but we hadn’t even touched it. We’d later learn that the park service
had put in a nice trail, which is what we’d been on. Nice! Nobody
mentions this anywhere, of course. All told it took us 5-6 hours to get
to the top from Glacier Lake.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/nahanni_2022/day_6_3.jpg"></img> <em>Home sweet
home</em></p>
<p>It was drizzling a little when we finally made it up to the beautiful
alpine wonderland of the fairy meadows, but the advance party
(M/Whitney/Mitch) had found a good campspot for us under an overhanging
rock. It was a really cool hang-out spot, and a few climbers before us
had built little tables, chairs and wind-breaks out of stacked stones.
There were even a few places to hang things off the ground so <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot">marmots</a> couldn’t get to
them.</p>
<p>Jason Magness had told us to look around the cirque for leftover food
from previous parties, and I was starting to feel greatly depleted from
the calorie defecit, so we did just that. The park service left a bunch
of metal crates up there to keep food from being eaten while people were
away, and a lot of parties just ditch things in them. I was grateful for
whatever was left, which was mostly sardines and a single jar of peanut
butter. Calories are calories! I’ve never had liferaft rations before,
but they were in there too. Not bad.</p>
<p>I did make the mistake of not cleaning the sardine tin very well, and
my food smelled like dead fish for the rest of the trip. Oh well.
Whitney gave me some extra instant coffee and I was pretty happy.</p>
<p>Whitney and M had some disagreement over how to do the climb, with M
favoring a single push and Whitney looking for more of a 2-day. After
talking with a guided party of three in a neighboring rock warren, we
all decided the 2-ish day approach would be better.</p>
<p>We’d gone over to talk to them since we saw them looking pretty
haggard and trudging in from somewhere, and all of their stuff was wet.
Turned out their weather window had gone bad and they’d been snowed on
during the upper pitches of the climb, and bailed. They gave us good
beta on the conditions up there, including the difficulty and how wet
things were probably going to be.</p>
<p>Megan asked them how hard it was and they all just looked at
eachother and laughed. It was funny and a little worrying. We all
decided that night to spend the next day putting up the static line I’d
hauled up, then go for a 2-day attempt the day after, with a bivvy in
the middle. Our weather window kind of forced us into that plan, but we
all were more or less psyched on it.</p>
<p>For once, the mosquitos mostly left us alone. We all retired to the
tents and kind of did our own thing in the evening. M was worried about
a burgeoning overuse injury in her arm, so we tried to figure out what
to do. Eventually we settled on full Ibuprofen doses around the clock,
but she didn’t know if she’d be able to do the climb. With nothing much
else to do except try to sleep, we went to bed. As usual, the sun was up
for way too long and it felt like it never truly got dark.</p>
<h1 id="day-7">Day 7</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/nahanni_2022/day_7_1.jpg"></img> <em>M looks up
towards the base of the climb</em></p>
<p>Day 7 was kind of a weird one. We got up at the usual time and did
breakfast and such before loading packs up for a short climbing day. The
plan was to <a
href="https://www.vdiffclimbing.com/big-wall-fixing-pitches/">fix</a>
the first three pitches of the climb, which are at a much greater
difficulty than the rest of the pitches on the first half of the tower
(and often wet) so that on our actual climbing day we can just ascend
them. To that end, I hauled up the 100 meters of static line and
everyone else brought gear, snacks, water and whatever else they wanted
to stash at the base of the climb.</p>
<p>First off, it wasn’t easy to get to the climb. Some reports mentioned
45 minutes, the guided party said something like two hours, it was all
over the place. I think the first time it took us around 90 minutes,
since we ended up traversing a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moraine">morraine</a> a few times
along a poorly marked, shifting trail to get to the base. At one point,
Scarlett, Mitch and Dirk took a weird path and went to a random
highpoint before joining back up with our trail again.</p>
<p>Once we all made it to the base of the climb, our work still wasn’t
done since there was a small snow ridge. I ended up cutting some stairs
into it with chunks of rock that I found and tossing the rope in so the
climbers could use it. Dirk was hanging out for in the sun to watch, and
Scarlett and I would just be in the way so we watched as well.</p>
<p>After a lot of finagling and figuring out systems/gear, Megan led up
the first pitch. It wasn’t as wet as we’d thought, but it was super
chossy and scary. Scarlett and I had originally planned to head up after
them, but the risk of rockfall was too great so we stayed behind. Poor
Mitch stood in place on the snow drift for like 90 minutes while Whitney
and M went up to a really uncomfortable belay.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/nahanni_2022/day_7_2.jpg"></img> <em>M belays
Whitney up to the top of pitch 1</em></p>
<p>They hauled up a backpack, then Mitch joined them. The whole thing
looked uncomfortable and like a lot of work. Whitney led up pitch 2 and
made a great show of it, looking strong on some overhanging, widening
cracks. Mitch had some trouble following up due to the absolutely
astronomical weight of the follower pack with all the extra gear on it
and aided up to a really comical spot, with all three of them hanging
together on one anchor.</p>
<p>After a good amount of shuffling, standing on eachother and pack
shifting, Mitch led up pitch three but bailed just under the
intimidating roof. M finished it out strong with some crazy moves to
skirt under it. Mitch came down and the rest of the gang followed a
while later, just after the sun set behind the ridge leading to Mt.
Proboscis. The rope was fixed without much other madness, but it had
taken something like seven hours to do three pitches. Yikes.</p>
<p>Scarlett and I, meanwhile, just hung out in the granite chaos below,
hiding from the sun. I mostly read articles on my phone, occasionally
watching the struggles up on the rock. I was glad they took on the task.
Thanks climbers! I screwed up on the trip by not bringing sunglasses and
burned my eyes, so I had a headache for the next 48 hours.</p>
<p>The evening was slightly apprehensive, with everyone deciding plans,
times, what to bring, etc. We all went to bed earlyish, hoping that the
day after would be a bit more smooth than today.</p>
<h1 id="day-8-lotus-day-1">Day 8 (Lotus day 1)</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/nahanni_2022/day_8_1.jpg"></img> <em>Scarlett
getting ready to jug up the fixed line. You can see Whitney already on
the line near the top of pitch two.</em></p>
<p>Megan and Whitney get up a bit earlier and head out before Scarlett,
Mitch and I do. They’re going first and we don’t want to be crowding
them at belays. My alarm doesn’t go off for some reason so I have a
semi-rushed morning, but all is well. Everything was packed the night
before so I only had to eat, drink some coffee and get going. We leave
around 7:45AM, and the packs feel heavy.</p>
<p>M is just about halfway up the fixed line by the time we get to the
base. Whitney starts up after we get there and we take our time sorting
packs and gear and making a “light” leader pack, which I take.
Eventually Scarlett starts up and makes it past the first re-belay on
the rock. I start up after her.</p>
<p>None of us had practiced ascending before the trip, and it takes a
while to figure out technique. Even with the lighter pack, I use way too
much energy and end up hosing my left arm for the rest of the day. It’s
exhausting work, especially after doing nothing but paddling and driving
for the previous couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Eventually, I make it up and theres a slight traffic jam. We’d left a
bag at the top of pitch three, and now both Whitney and Scarlett are
there hanging with it. I stay below for a while. Sooner or later
everything is sorted out, Megan and Whitney are out of the belay and I
start up.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/nahanni_2022/day_8_2.jpg"></img> <em>Mitch
following up one of the chimney pitches carrying the heavy pig</em></p>
<p>It’s easy climbing but sketchy: Loose chunks, big hollow flakes,
dirty ledges and cracks full of grass. Luckily someone has scraped out
parts of the grassy cracks so that I can put protection in. M gives me
some pointers about loose things from up above, and I make it to the
first belay with only some moderate panic.</p>
<p>I belay Mitch and Scarlett up, and we’re on our way. I make some
mistakes on the next pitch and have to do some exciting dynamic moves as
well as a weird downclimb to get into the chimneys. Luckily M and
Whitney have done a lot of the flailing and route finding already, and M
points out the first couple of good belays. Eventually we lose sight of
them and I’m on my own.</p>
<p>Things go well, but my arms start cramping. Mentally, I curse my poor
technique on the jugging. My left arm is way worse, but I fight through
it and try to hydrate. We’re well into the chimney now, and after 4
full, long, 60 meter pitches I hand over the lead to Mitch. He takes off
and I’m really sad about how heavy the bag he was carrying is on my
shoulders. Poor Scarlett had the heaviest one of all of us and was
working really hard.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/nahanni_2022/day_8_3.jpg"></img> <em>Mitch
fires up his first lead after the swap</em></p>
<p>Scarlett and I trade delirious conversation as Mitch presses up
towards the top. We eventually make it out of the chimneys, and Megan
cheers us on as we near the last pitch to the ledge. Mitch takes a while
but sends the hardest pitch of the day with some clutch secret-hold
finding. Scarlett and I enjoy a good long sit just below while he makes
it up. We follow and collapse onto the bivy ledge, which is as
incredible as everyone makes it sounds. Whitney is already half asleep,
but we all chat and eat dinner. We’re all totally hosed.</p>
<p>The next pitch looks seriously difficult, but we’re all happy after a
brutal twelve hour day. I curl into the corner, everyone finds a good
spot and we go to sleep pretty early. The moon is aggressive as soon as
it rises and it’s like someone is shining a flashlight on us all night,
but I don’t think anyone really noticed.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/nahanni_2022/day_8_4.jpg"></img> <em>The gang
on the bivy ledge. Mitch is closest to the crack of doom, which is the
de facto latrine on the route</em></p>
<h1 id="day-9-lotus-day-2">Day 9 (Lotus day 2)</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/nahanni_2022/day_9_1.jpg"></img> <em>Megan
starts up after Whitney on pitch 11</em></p>
<p>Whitney and Megan get up super early, but not as early as they’d
like. The rest of us kind of snooze. I am dead out, apparently, and am
not awake until somebody tries very hard to get me up. It’s the first
time I’d been warm sleeping on the whole trip, very cozy. The sun hits
the ledge about the time Megan and Whitney are ready to go up.</p>
<p>Whitney hangs once or twice on the pitch but otherwise makes short
work of it- it doesn’t look any less exciting. It’s an overhanging
fingercrack that squeezes shut, making some sections kind of run out.
It’s intimidating and I’m super sore. Mitch, Scarlett and I agree to
give it a go even though we’re all ready to go back down. I start up
after M is at the next belay- I leave my pack and go with a light rack
since I’m only interested in getting to the top of this pitch.</p>
<p>Off the ground, it’s not too bad, but it gets hard. It’s kind of a
lie-back, it’s thin, and I don’t feel super strong. I get through some
sections just fine, but sew it up and piece-to-piece it toward the top.
In general I make it look REALLY hard. After like 45 minutes or an hour
or something of making myself feel silly, I make it to the top and lower
down. Scarlett and Mitch make it look way better than I did, and we all
unanimously agree to just head back to camp.</p>
<p>We pack up our stuff, leave a bunch of water for Megan and Whitney
who seem to be having a real trial up on the pitches above, and say our
goodbyes before beginning the 10 rappels we’ll need to reach the ground
again.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/nahanni_2022/day_9_2.jpg"></img> <em>Mitch
getting ready to lower off the bivy ledge</em></p>
<p>It’s an uncomfortable few hours back to the ground. All three of us
are hanging at belays, stepping on toes, joking, cooking in the sun,
etc. We eventually work out a system and it’s not too bad. Funnily
enough, the last couple rappels take the longest since we unfix the
static line and take the backpack we’d left at the top of pitch three.
It feels like real blue collar mountaineering.</p>
<p>We’re happy to be on the ground, I chug a bunch of water and we start
heading back to camp through the morraine.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/nahanni_2022/day_9_3.jpg"></img> <em>Walking
back to camp</em></p>
<p>I give out mentally just as we get back, glad to be rid of the static
rope once again, but it wouldn’t be the last time I’d carry it. I drink
some coffee, poop after not doing so since the day before and take a
nap. I think everyone takes a nap, actually. I spend some time wandering
around camp, eating everything in sight and trying to rehydrate. Every
now and then we check back on Whitney and Megan with the help of the
binoculars and track progress to make sure they’re doing okay.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/nahanni_2022/day_9_4.jpg"></img> <em>If you
look very closely, you can see Megan and Whitney near the top of Lotus
Flower Tower</em></p>
<p>Just as it starts to get dark, we see them summit. I do some mental
calculations and set an alarm for around one in the morning. They still
have a long way to go.</p>
<p>When I get out of the tent at 1AM, I walk up to where I can see the
tower in the dark and I can <em>just</em> barely make out some
headlamps. I figure it’s another two hours, so I set my alarm and back
to bed I go.</p>
<p>I have a bunch of weird dreams, and then at 4AM I hear people
rustling around camp so I get up and go to meet them: They tell me how
hard the upper pitches were, how delirious and crazy the hike back was,
and how nervous they were about the clouds moving in. Way more exciting
than our trudge back to camp. I’m not quite awake enough to really
appreciate the whole thing, but I make them some hot water and we all go
to bed.</p>
<h1 id="day-10">Day 10</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/nahanni_2022/day_10_1.jpg"></img> <em>Megan
relaxes after three brutal days of climbing</em></p>
<p>Nobody gets up until 11:00AM or so. The sun cooks the tent and Megan
and I get up to go eat. Whitney is a stone in his tent for a little
while longer, but theres cautious, slow movement from everyone else. We
all hang out for a bit and Whitney gets up too, and everyone shares
various battle stories from the day before. I guess M and Whitney ended
up hallucinating on the way back and couldn’t find the cairns that
marked the trail. The upper pitches sounded <strong>very</strong> rough
and I’m glad my team decided to bail.</p>
<p>Everyone wanders off eventually: I go to scout for bolted lines on
random boulders in the meadow, Whitney takes a nap and then heads up a
valley looking for a swimming hole, Mitch goes up a different valley
looking for sheep and high points, and M disappears without anyone
really noticing.</p>
<p>Much later, like a few hours later, I see her up near the bathrooms
after passing out in a small field. She’d found an
<strong>awesome</strong> looking roof crack right nearby, which we
agreed to check out when we weren’t falling apart. Then she fell asleep,
just laying in the grass. Very idyllic. We wandered around for a while,
checking out rocks and bolted lines and looking for food. It was nice.
We even watched part of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meru_(film)">Meru</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/nahanni_2022/day_10_2.jpg"></img> <em>M on top
of one of the boulders near camp</em></p>
<p>We eat dinner, play a few games, and go to bed early. Everyone is
totally fried.</p>
<h1 id="day-11">Day 11</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/nahanni_2022/day_11_1.jpg"></img> <em>Me
leading one of the weird little cracks we found. Very tricky, bouldery
start. Photo by Scarlett.</em></p>
<p>Mitch and Scarlett and I ended up cragging on day 11. They’d spotted
some good lines up near the Huey Spires so we wandered up there and took
turns going up weird routes. There were a few good ones that we felt
comfortable enough leading, but a lot had bizarre anchors and were full
of lichen. Some looked amazing but were super long and strenuous. We
climbed a few and then headed back down.</p>
<p>Dirk, Scarlett and Mitch returned to Glacier Lake in the afternoon to
get more food. Whitney, M and I stayed up in camp and just hung out. I
read <a
href="https://www.robertcrais.com/books/book_the_watchman.htm">The
Watchman</a> cover to cover in the evening. How do you pass up a $5
book? “Taut, Muscular Thriller” becamse something of a catchphrase after
reading one of the reviews on the back of the book.</p>
<h1 id="day-12">Day 12</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/nahanni_2022/day_12_1.jpg"></img> <em>Whitney
after successfully leading the mystery roof hand crack Megan found.
Photo by Megan.</em></p>
<p>Those of us that stayed up in the meadow packed our things, had
breakfast and then spent the morning working the roof crack above the
toilets. It was super burly, but Whitney sent it on his second go. I
gave it two really ugly attempts and called it good, totally
defeated.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/nahanni_2022/day_12_2.jpg"></img> <em>Me
desperately trying to figure out how to stay in the roof. Photo by
Megan.</em></p>
<p>We headed down in the afternoon, in pleasant temps. We were
absolutely amazed out our weather window: Aside from the drizzle on the
hike up, we’d had sun every day. It was a nice hike down, but I was
exhausted from battling the roof and carrying the damn static line back
down. I was happy to be back in camp.</p>
<p>Along the way we passed a group of four from Vancouver heading up to
attempt the LFT, and another group of four from Spain planning to spend
two weeks up in the cirque. They looked exactly how I felt on the hike
in, with heavy bags and 2000 more vertical feet to go. We felt a little
sorry for the Vancouver boys since their weather window was super short
and they were going to have to pull some long days.</p>
<p>We had a good evening in camp, with everyone happy to have extra food
to eat. We all repacked gear, dropped fishy-smelling trash in bags to be
flown out, ditched bad breakfasts, and used the toilet for the last
time. M and I spent the night in the little cabin there.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/nahanni_2022/day_12_3.jpg"></img> <em>M and I
just before hiking out of the meadow</em></p>
<p>Thus ends out time in the cirque. Next up, the final leg of the
journey.</p>
