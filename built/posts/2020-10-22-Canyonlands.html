<p><strong>Eric over at <a
href="https://www.packraftingadventures.com/">packrafting adventures</a>
designed and put this trip together.</strong></p>
<p>This July, I decided to finally take a <a
href="https://swiftwatersafetyinstitute.com/ssi-courses/packraft-specific-training/">Swiftwater
Safety Course</a> and up my safety game on whitewater. The course ended
up being really underwhelming, but I got to meet a few cool people, and
Eric was one of them. Eric is an aventure racer and general outdoor
enthusiast with a penchant for maps and long routes with a bit of
suffering involved. We bonded over backcountry travel, alpine-style, and
kept in contact after the class.</p>
<p>Fast-forward a month or so, and Eric invites me on a <a
href="https://backcountrypost.com/threads/canyonlands-figure-8-packrafting-loop-through-the-needles-and-maze-district.6537/">canyonlands
figure-8</a> of his own devising. The general idea is that you start
somewhere in the <a
href="https://www.nps.gov/cany/index.htm">Canyonlands of Utah</a>, hit
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River">Colorado
River</a> to the confluence with the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_River_(Colorado_River)">Green
river</a>, hike up and then do it in reverse (Green -&gt; Colorado).
This is a pretty neat trip in the backpacking/packrafting world.</p>
<p>We figured out dates (mid-September) and fired it off. Eric did all
the schmoozing with park rangers and logistics, and I agreed to just
have a good attitude about carrying heavy packs.</p>
<h1 id="day-0">Day 0</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/canyonlands/day_0.jpg" /></p>
<p>Prep involved five days of food, at least 4.5L of water, bags to poop
into, paddling gear and clothing. The food all had to be put into <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_River_(Colorado_River)">rat
sacks</a> because apparently rodents are a big problem on the waterway.
We also had to carry a <a href="https://suspiciousdevices.com/">fire
pan</a> even though a statewide fireban was in effect. The rules have
since been rewritten here, but it was annoying.</p>
<p>Our packs ended up being 60+ pounds, with water and food.
Soul-crushing, especially since I believe the Hyperlight Mountain Gear
4400s we were both using tend to collapse with heavy loads.</p>
<p>I kept it light by only bringing one set of clothing, but three pairs
of socks. Socks are important. Don’t skimp.</p>
<h1 id="day-1">Day 1</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/canyonlands/day_1.jpg" /></p>
<p>We woke up early that first day and drove out to place the car
shuttle. It was nice and cool in the evening and I listened to Dark Side
of the Moon the whole way out there. It was nice to have a whole week
off to just go sleep in the desert. We were out and walking into our
first canyon just an hour or so later.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/canyonlands/day_1_1.jpg" /></p>
<p>That first day was mostly getting used to the weight of the packs and
descending into slot canyons, walking on cobble-ish rocks and over soft
sand and down. We covered about 6.5 miles to the Colorado river,
exploring the canyons and slowly getting baked out by the sun, then had
a glorious transition and paddled to <a
href="https://thetrekplanner.com/canyonlands-spanish-bottom/">Spanish
Bottom</a>.</p>
<p>The river was low, flat and slow but it felt amazing to be in the
boat instead of carrying it.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/canyonlands/day_1_2.jpg" /></p>
<p>We had enough time after getting to camp we decided to hike up and
check out <a
href="https://thetrekplanner.com/canyonlands-the-dollhouse-granaries/">the
dollhouse</a>. The hike up was pretty steep, something like 2500 feet,
but it was worth it without packs.</p>
<p>After exploring for a while and failing to find the actual Anasazi
Granary, we headed back down to camp and to sleep, going to bed pretty
early. My notes mention something about a “Flotilla of Scum”, which was
a reference to the random collections of pond scum and foam on the
river.</p>
<h1 id="day-2">Day 2</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/canyonlands/day_2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Day two was a hard day for me. We agreed to wake up at 5:30 every
morning just so we’d have time to hike before the sun totally destroyed
us. It was actually really nice to get into the rhythm, it definitely
set the expectation for how the day was going to go, too. Eric is an
efficient machine at packing, and I like to eat oatmeal, so we usually
wouldn’t leave camp before 7:00 or so.</p>
<p>Starting our hike with the same 2500 foot climb as the previous day,
but with our fully loaded packs, was pretty morale destroying. We’d end
up covering 18 miles before going to sleep however, so it only got
harder.</p>
<p>We started off by going to the overlook point, which was nice because
we got to ditch the packs for a while and see the river from as high up
as possible.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/canyonlands/day_2_1.jpg" /></p>
<p>From there we hiked down and back around, dropping briefly into Water
Canyon and then mindlessly slogging up Shot Canyon. Water was hard to
find and I felt pretty terrible most of the day. The sun was always
there.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/canyonlands/day_2_2.jpg" /></p>
<p>For some reason I thought getting to Chimney Rock would be some kind
of relief from marching in the heat, but it really just marked the
midpoint of the day. We kept slogging, eventually dropping off of the
plateau and down back into <a
href="https://www.nps.gov/cany/planyourvisit/maze.htm">the maze</a>
itself. We spent the rest of the day trudging slowly through soft sand.
We did get to pass the gallery though, so that was pretty cool.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/canyonlands/day_2_3.jpg" /></p>
<p>We setup camp in Horse Canyon, then found a small spring for water
and trudged back. We were absolutely destroyed and in bed by 7:45PM.</p>
<h1 id="day-3">Day 3</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/canyonlands/day_3.jpg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“These Goddamned deranged canyon bats” - Eric</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We woke up at 5:30 again, in the dark. It was a slower paced morning
because we didn’t have to pack up the rafts. We took our time and
enjoyed the morning. The spring was a bit more full this morning so we
topped off water before beginning the long trek down to the Green.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/canyonlands/day_3_1.jpg" /></p>
<p>Walking through Horse Canyon was much suffering: Soft Sand and heavy
packs. Eric did a good job of navigating us through the shortest path
though, sometimes pushing us to bushwhack a little bit, sometimes
kicking us through cactuses. Kicking a cactus sucks, but is kind of
cosmically hilarious. At least the sun wasn’t oppressive early in the
morning. We made pretty good time and got to the end of the canyon after
only a few hours. We dropped the packs and walked down as far as we
could go, which ended at a long rappel down to the next chunk of the
canyon.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/canyonlands/day_3_2.jpg" /></p>
<p>We scrambled up and around into something that’s unofficially just
called “Pre-Horse Canyon” and dropped all the way down to the Green
River proper. It was a long, funny descent and we had a brief moment of
panic when the path ended with a sheer 25-foot drop into the water
below. Luckily you can just walk upriver a bit and put-in without a
hilarious <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szZ3sqZDSfk">seal
launch</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/canyonlands/day_3_3.jpg" /></p>
<p>Putting in at the Green.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/canyonlands/day_3_4.jpg" /></p>
<p>After through hours of paddling, which felt amazing after trudging
through sand for a few days, we arrived at camp: A nice little sandy
beach that slowly eroded as we slept.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/canyonlands/day_3_5.jpg" /></p>
<p>It was our first chance to wash off the canyon-grime and we both
jumped into the river while there was still some sun. We again went to
bed pretty early after just lazing it up on the beach for a while.</p>
<h1 id="day-4">Day 4</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/canyonlands/day_4.jpg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m as masochistic as the next guy but I don’t paddle flatwater all
day just to reward myself with hot olive slop” - Eric, on the worst
dehydrated meal he’d ever had.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We were both feeling pretty lazy but managed to get up while it was
dark. Nothing was totally dry but it was dry enough: My single <a
href="https://www.nrs.com/product/10139.04/nrs-mens-h2core-silkweight-hoodie">NRS
Silkweight Hoodie</a> was starting to feel pretty stiff and salty, but
it was time to put on my next pair of clean socks so that felt
amazing.</p>
<p>We paddled for a few hours after breaking camp and made it back to
basically where we’d been a few days before, across from Spanish Bottom.
We’d seen a lot of parties camped along the banks. Turns out when you
don’t want to run Cataract Canyon, you just wait until the jetboat comes
to pick you up. It seems very wrong to me to float down a peaceful chunk
of water only to have a boat with a huge engine ferry you back up days
later.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/canyonlands/day_4_1.jpg" /></p>
<p>This was probably the hardest day for Eric: Water was a problem the
whole trip, both because it was hard to find and again because the river
water was full of silt. This required us to “settle” it over night with
alum, which makes the water taste like deoderant, and then carry it with
us over long, dry distances. For camp this night, there’d be absolutely
no water so Eric came up with the idea of carrying two and a half
gallons of water or so up to the <a
href="https://www.gjhikes.com/2014/10/devils-pocket.html">Devil’s
Pocket</a> where we’d be sleeping. He basically carried a kettlebell all
day, up the canyons, through the sun and still with heavy packs.
Absolutely brutal, but we had water for that day and the next.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/canyonlands/day_4_2.jpg" /></p>
<p>We were so messed up by mid-afternoon we decided to just stop at our
campsite and rest. We’d had grand ambitions of a day hike, but climbing
all the way up the canyon walls in the sun really destroyed us. I was
totally dehydrated and Eric was all twisted because of the
water-haul-in-the-drybag-technique. We just sat and ate all the food we
had and hid from the sun. It was a tough day.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/canyonlands/day_4_3.jpg" /></p>
<p>We slept well in our slot canyon campsite.</p>
<h1 id="day-5">Day 5</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/canyonlands/day_5.jpg" /></p>
<p>The final day, and our biggest on foot. We had light (sorta) packs,
just enough foul-tasting water to get by and only a single day’s worth
of food left. We decided to push it and went for a bigger loop.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/canyonlands/day_5_1.jpg" /></p>
<p>We mostly trekked with our own thoughts through weird, deserty alien
rock formations. The terrain changed wildly, from smooth, water-worn
rock with iron ladders to drop us into canyons, to overgrown and shady
forested floors. At this point we’d seen so much wild terrain we were
ignorant to the strangeness of it all.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/canyonlands/day_5_2.jpg" /></p>
<p>We finally started to see people, too, which was when we really knew
it was over. An older couple we talked to for a while said they were
visiting their last feature in the canyonlands: they’d seen everything
else. They called themselves Desert Rats and I really liked that. It was
inspiring to see people who’d spent enough time in the desert to
literally see it all: Every arch, canyon and petroglyph.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/canyonlands/day_5_3.jpg" /></p>
<p>And just like that, after 90 miles through the sun and the river, we
were back at the car. We threw away all our wag bags (oof), ate the rest
of our food and headed back to Moab to drink clean water and find
showers.</p>
