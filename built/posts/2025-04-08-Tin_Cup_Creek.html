<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>Tin Cup Creek is an unpaddled tributary of the Chetco River in the
Klamiopsis Wilderness of southern Oregon. It’s access is both
unmaintained and extremely difficult, which is why, until now, no one
has gotten in there to check it out.</p>
<p>Depending on what map you are looking at, a trail exists branching
off from the Chetco Divide trail and going up Tin Cup Creek proper, but
in my communications with the <a
href="https://siskiyoumountainclub.org/">Siskiyou Mountain Club</a> no
one has actually worked on that trail for a very long time. In the
Kalmiopsis this means it might as well not exist, due to fires and the
general rugged nature of the area.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/img/tin_cup/low_water_1.jpg"></img>
<em>One of the only images I was able to find, from the Siskiyou
Mountain Club</em></p>
<p>The only two logical ways to get in there, then, are via the Illinois
River (and the mysterious “Tin Cup Pass”) or to do a big overland day on
the Kalmiopsis Rim Trail and drop into the headwaters somewhere. The
only drawback with this is the awful bushwhack up and over the pass from
South Bend: It’s steep, very dense and completely unknown.</p>

<em>Austen pans across the confluence with the Chetco in his <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbyODfE5cRQ">excellent

<p>I’d been chatting with various people for a few years now and haven’t
been able to make it happen, until I finally linked up with <a
href="https://mthoodh2o.blogspot.com/">Jacob Cruser</a> on the <a
href="https://mthoodh2o.blogspot.com/2025/03/minam-river.html">Minam
River</a> last year and we started talking about it. He’d actually
attempted this same route years before with hardshells and given up, so
he was really the only other person in the world that knew anything
about this route. I’d emailed him in my various campaigns before as
well, so I think he knew I was serious about it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/img/tin_cup/confluence.jpg"></img>
<em>My own visit to the confluence last year on my <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgCtjUbFFDw">Chetco
trip</a></em></p>
<p>One handshakey agreement later on that trip and we agreed to go for
the logical Illinois River -&gt; Tin Cup Creek -&gt; Chetco River
triple. If anything, it would be a cool link up and a first descent. How
bad could the bushwhack be? The mystery compels.</p>
<h1 id="day-1">Day 1</h1>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/img/tin_cup/day_1_0.jpg"></img>
<em>A rapid on the Illinois, photo cr. Jacob Cruser</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I think it’s going to be six miles of Conehead.” - Jacob, musing on
the nature of Tin Cup Creek before seeing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We met up the night before and camped out at one of the standard
Chetco River take-outs, the bridge. It had been kind of cold and we were
fully immersed in a fog bank. It would be a theme: lots of moisture.</p>
<p>We left soonish after waking up and drove straight to Gasquet where
we picked up a shuttle driver. He was very chatty, doing quite a lot to
diminish our apprehension about putting on the Illinois at ~3500
CFS.</p>
<p>Sadly, I shot quite a bit of GoPro during our Illinois descent, but
the discount SD card I bought died. I wasn’t able to recover anything
off of it. Never buy the returned SD cards from Fred Meyer! We were
pretty conservative given the nature of the trip. It was good fun, and
all lines went well.</p>
<p>We pretty much snuck every rapid: Shout out to the <a
href="https://www.whitewaterguidebook.com/oregon/illinois-river/">Whitewater
Guidebook</a> page on the Illinois and some phone-beta our friend Jim
sent us. The mileages were super accurate and the descriptions were
great.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/img/tin_cup/day_1_1.jpg"></img>
<em>South Bend camp</em></p>
<p>We were able to camp right at South Bend, a good ways above Green
Wall, and scout out the start to our “hike” a little bit. We spend the
evening swapping stories and drinking a little whisky.</p>
<h1 id="day-2">Day 2</h1>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/img/tin_cup/day_2_0.jpg"></img>
<em>Jacob takes the opportunity to stay above the foliage</em></p>
<p>Neither of us slept super well: cold and wet. Back in the cloud. We
ate and packed up, leaving around 9.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Have you read the Long Walk? It’s very compelling.” - Jacob, at one
of the comically small rests we found in the brush.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There wasn’t much to say or do other than to just get to it: It was
horrible. I immediately tried to lead us into Poison Oak, which wasn’t
blooming yet, but Jacob knows the stuff very well and always steered us
straight.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/img/tin_cup/day_2_1.jpg"></img>
<em>Jacob saws through a stout little set of branches</em></p>
<p>I’d picked up a <a
href="https://suluk46.com/product/yuka-240-pull-saw/">lightweight
pull-saw</a> from Suluk46 just for the trip, and it proved invaluable:
if anything, just to stop and do something other than grovel with a
giant backpack on.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/img/tin_cup/day_2_5.jpg"></img>
<em>Exasperated at a rest point</em></p>
<p>It took us four hours to cover the next half-mile, and about a
thousand feet of elevation gain. The path was winding, tortuous and
impossible to see. We would fight our way up through steep, crumbling
dirt and through very tight bushes into poison oak infested pods which
we would try to move around. 1 liter of water was not enough. Every now
and then we would sit in a small, rounded out clearish area next to a
burned tree and rest. It was very slow going.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/img/tin_cup/day_2_2.jpg"></img></p>
<p>Eventually we made it to leveler, clearer ground at a sort of
plateau, where I discovered my PFD had come off somewhere in the
bushwhack. I had a sort-of good idea where it’d happened, so off I went
back down the hill. It took me 40 minutes to find it, but I did.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/img/tin_cup/day_2_3.jpg"></img></p>
<p>From there it was a little easier going up until the very top of the
pass, but not much. We were kind of wasted and I was definitely
dehydrated. Lots of cramping. We briefly celebrated with a snack up at
the very top and then started picking our way down. A small spring
helped us get back on top of the dehydration spiral.</p>
<p>The backside was better, but there were thick sections of madrones
that really slowed us down: just standing completely on branches and
falling through trees to try and gain a few feet was the name of the
game. Eventually we were able to make it to the creek: A very welcome
sight.</p>
<p>There wasn’t much of a campsite, so we had a little <a
href="https://nonormal.com/">coffee paste</a>, ate some snickers bars
and inflated our packrafts. We carefully scrubbed everything down with
soap, because the contact with poison oak was inevitable. Everything
sacrificed to the bushwhack went into drybags and stuffed deep into the
boats.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/img/tin_cup/day_2_4.jpg"></img>
<em>High hopes</em></p>
<p>We had just enough water, and were able to pick our way down. After a
portage at Heather Creek (big log jam!) we found a nice boof, pictured
above. I wasn’t sure about running it given how tired and beat up we
were, but Jacob is more experienced in these things and pointed out it
might not be runnable in the morning. We gave it a go, and it was
amazing.</p>
<p>A few more bedrock rapids later and found a nice, giant camp that
would work for both of us near a waterfall. It didn’t take us long to
fall asleep.</p>
