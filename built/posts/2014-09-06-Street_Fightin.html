<p>After some coffee and a donut, I made my way out to the random internet/board game cafe thing that was hosting it and signed up. Since I'd gotten there really early I went and hung out in a cafe for a while and <a href="https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/xriJWW7p">fucked around on irc for a while</a>.</p>
<p>After meeting some of my arcade friends (who knew you could bond with random people over a video game in a foreign county?) we went up for some <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/104820964@N07/14970120018/">casuals</a>. Daigo, Xian, Humanbomb, Lapchi Duong, Gamerbee and a handful of other really good international players were there to kick ass.</p>
<p>When the tournament finally started I was in pool A, and my first match went really well. My second match was kind of close and after that I got my ass kicked by some random taiwanese Ibuki player. Going 2-1 is about average for my tournament record.</p>
<p>I hung out some more, ate some random bread with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rousong">pork floss</a> (So thats what that shit is!) and waited for the next set of pools to start.</p>
<p>Some of my friends did pretty well, one went as far as 4-2, which is really good. He even said it was his first tournament! Crazy. I should've brought my stick.</p>
<p>At some point I ended up chatting with the owner of the cafe thing, a starcraft player. His english was really good, and he, like everyone else so far, said I was dumb for just sitting in Taipei for so long. Yeah, yeah I'll get around eventually.</p>
<p>After the second set of pools was over we ended up going to McDonalds. Fun little chat, whatever. I also met a Japanese guy who said he was a fan of Daigo.</p>
<p>After a pretty exciting top 8, they held a raffle where I ended up winning a shirt. It's a pretty cool looking thing, stereotypical black-on-green razer stuff.</p>
<p>First rule in life is to just show up, right?</p>
