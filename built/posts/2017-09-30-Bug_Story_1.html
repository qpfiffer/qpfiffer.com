I’ve wanted to write this one up for a while
so here goes.</p>
<h3 id="symptom-were-out-of-money.-in-the-stripe-account.">Symptom:
We’re out of money. In the Stripe account.</h3>
<p>Well that’s weird. Why are we out of money? For some context, I work
for a market-to-market startup that has customers paying for other
people to sign up for group classes, and then the person teaching the
classes gets paid. We (the startup) take a cut of that. Simple. See:
Uber, Etsy, Lyft, etc.</p>
<p>We have to have a constant balance in the Stripe account to make sure
that we can do promos or coupons. This helps us incentivize people to
use the platform. Makes sense, right? Well, today we’re out of
money.</p>
<p>Anyway, we’re out of money. Usually no big deal, we’ll just top it up
and be on our way, but this time is suspicious because we <em>just</em>
topped up, and we’re out again already. Interesting. Let’s dig
further.</p>
<h3
id="symptom-looks-like-someone-has-way-more-money-in-their-stripe-connected-account-than-they-should.">Symptom:
Looks like someone has WAY more money in their <a
href="https://stripe.com/connect">Stripe Connected account</a> than they
should.</h3>
<p>Well, thats weird. Looks like this particular person has gotten the
same $20.00 payment over and over and over again for the last three
days. This sucks, but it isn’t bad since the way our system is written,
it protects us from actually losing all of that money. The system
controlling actual payouts from Stripe -&gt; (Real World Bank) panics
and cowardly refuses to do anything if it detects something is
amiss.</p>
<p>Immediately this smells like a bad cron job. The same thing happening
over and over and over again? Very smelly. Luckily for us, we really
only have two different cron jobs that could’ve done this. One is pretty
simple, and the other is slightly more complex. I’m hoping it’s the
simpler one.</p>
<h3
id="symptom-weird-errors-being-thrown-from-one-of-the-cron-jobs">Symptom:
Weird errors being thrown from one of the cron jobs</h3>
<p>After digging through the simple cron job and finding nothing (well
that’s good at least) I start digging through logs. We use <a
href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> so “digging through
logs” kinda sucks. At this point, I also hadn’t yet realized that our
secondary exception logging service, <a
href="https://sentry.io/iat-labs/">Sentry</a>, didn’t work correctly in
the cron-style job execution environment we were using. Since no one was
emailing me, I thought everything was fine.</p>
<p>The cron-style asynchronous execution environment probably deserves
some explaining. To manage deployments to Lambda, we use a Python tool
called <a href="https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa">Zappa</a>. Zappa is
pretty cool, and recently added the ability to schedule cron jobs using
the official Lambda cron scheduler <a
href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-scheduled-events.html">thing</a>.
Neat. This is perfect for us, since it allows us to set up a simple job,
inside of our lambda, that has access to all of the environment
variables and Django models and whatever else we need to make sure
things get done.</p>
<p>All you have to do is define a job in your
<code>zappa_settings.json</code> file and you’re good to go. Dead
simple. Let’s move on.</p>
<h3
id="symptom-the-transactions-were-seeing-in-stripe-are-not-in-our-database">Symptom:
The transactions we’re seeing in stripe are not in our database</h3>
<p>Well, that’s certainly weird. EVERYTHING that touches stripe in the
codebase is logged and frozen to a corresponding model. I save
everything, nothing get’s deleted. It’s money so we try to be as safe as
possible.</p>
<p>Not seeing ANY sort of model with corresponding
<code>stripe_transaction_id</code>s is very weird and kind of scary. How
could that happen? Then I remember a lot of our cron job’s code is
wrapped inside a single, big atomic transaction. Hmmm. That’s a big
clue.</p>
<h3
id="symptom-the-errors-being-thrown-have-nothing-to-do-with-the-account-were-investigating">Symptom:
The errors being thrown have nothing to do with the account we’re
investigating</h3>
<p>Well, that’s weird but I guess it’s okay. Let’s take a look at the
code to see what’s going on. After some digging I notice this bit of
code, in our cron job (code is simplified):</p>
<pre><code>def payout_cron_job():
    with transaction.atomic():
        for account in managed_accounts:
            # ...
            # do some math, check some numbers, manage some records
            # ...
            stripe_transaction_id = Stripe.Transfer.create(...)
            payment.payed_out_tx_id = stripe_transaction_id
            payment.payed_out_timestamp = timezone.now()
            # ...
            notify_user_of_payout(...)</code></pre>
<p>After looking at this code, and thinking about the last symptom we
saw, I figured out why we were erroring out. The error itself had
something to do with an incorrect email. This was fine, and easy to fix,
so I did. I also made the notification code more error-safe. No problem.
The actual issue here is how we are handling the transaction.</p>
<p>Wrapping all accounts in one big transaction means the entire thing
fails when any one of those side-effecty, third-party calls fails. This
could mean either a Stripe call failed (bad card, not enough money, no
bank account details, etc.) or the <code>notify_user_of_payout</code>
call fails (bad email, not device token for a push notification, etc).
Any one of these 3rd party calls could blow up the hole thing and roll
back the transaction. Not awesome.</p>
<p>Since those 3rd party calls control things outside of our database,
they don’t get rolled back when OUR database does. This sucks. This
means that even though someone might successfully get paid out, anyone
that blows up the transaction while we’re looping through all of the
<code>managed_accounts</code> will mean we have no record of them
getting paid out. Nice.</p>
<p>The better code looks more like this:</p>
<pre><code>def payout_cron_job():
    for account in managed_accounts:
        with transaction.atomic():
            # ...</code></pre>
<p>We create a new transaction for each account we loop through,
therefore isolating them from each-other. In the future, we’ll also have
a promise-style Transaction chain that can control commits and
roll-backs on 3rd-party incumbents. That way, if the stripe transaction
fails for one person, we could roll-back all of them. That’d be pretty
nice.</p>
<p>So now that we’ve fixed our cron job, we have to figure out why it
failed and then <em>kept</em> failing. The cron job only runs every
hour, so why was the errant user getting money ever four minutes? To
figure that out, we have to dig into the Lambda documentation a little
bit.</p>
<h3
id="symptom-cron-job-fails-and-loops-and-keeps-failing-forever">Symptom:
Cron job fails and loops and keeps failing FOREVER</h3>
<p>I remembered reading something about a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_letter_queue">dead letter
queue</a> in the lambda documentation. If you don’t know what that is, a
quick definition is that whenever a job or message processor fails to
finish processing a message (in this case a job), the queue doesn’t
remove that message/job. So, in our case since the job itself kept
failing, amazon kept telling it to execute. Usually a good idea, if your
errors are freaks of nature and prone to temporal resolution.</p>
<p>So, that’s what happened here. Our task kept going, partially
succeeding, erroring out and then dying. Amazon, faithful executor that
it is, decided to keep retrying. This meant that the same account kept
getting paid out every execution, eg. every four minutes.</p>
<h3 id="fix-reverse-all-the-bad-transactions">Fix: Reverse all the bad
transactions</h3>
<p>After finally putting these pieces together I deployed the fixed code
and explained what had happened to my co-workers. They left me the task
of fixing all of the bad transactions myself. Just punishment for some
irresponsible code, I’d say. Worth it, for such a combo of small errors
leading to such a catastrophic bug.</p>
