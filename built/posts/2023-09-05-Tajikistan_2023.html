<p>In August of 2023, for our annual vacation-adventure thing we decided
to go to Tajikistan. Initially we’d planned to head to Baffin Island,
but trying to get there from the Faroe Islands was non-trivial and we
didn’t really know how to deal with polar bears. We also really liked
Kyrgyzstan last time we were there, so we were very excited to go.</p>
<h1 id="plan">Plan</h1>
<p>We didn’t really have any idea what we’d be doing in the country
until a few weeks ahead of time- I’d had a bunch of rivers I wanted to
do, we only really had packrafts and that was about it. Somehow,
eventually, we were tipped off to the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murghob">Murghab River</a>. Megan
was a little iffy about paddling anything Class IVish, and this looked
relatively doable, so we decided to try it.</p>
<p>A few russian teams have descended the river (<a
href="https://www.ski.ru/az/blogs/post/murgab-bartang-1990/">here is a
good trip report</a>) but otherwise it’s kind of unknown. A <a
href="https://pamirs.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/its-all-about-kok-jar/">team
of kayakers</a> had also descended it, which gave us some good english
beta. For the most part, we didn’t really know what we’d be in for:
Probably lots of terrible lake miles, some way-too-big-class-V+ that
we’d have to portage, high altitudes, and a lot of beautiful scenery.
Perfect.</p>
<p>We eventually settled on a plan to paddle the river, cross Lake Sarez
to the Irkht Valley and hike out to the town of Bachor. What could go
wrong?</p>
<p><a href="https://pamirtrips.com/">Pamir Trips</a> was instrumental in
helping us figure out a lot of the logistics. Sharaf was very helpful
and responsive.</p>
<h1 id="a-new-lake">A New Lake?</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/the_new_lake.png"></img></p>
<p>I was doing some route-scoping on SentinelHub and stumbled upon a new
lake recently formed on our route, right where all of the really
difficult whitewater was supposed to be. Apparently an <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china-reports-magnitude-73-earthquake-near-border-with-tajikistan-2023-02-23/">earthquake</a>
in February 2023 had triggered a landslide along the river, blocking it
and damming it, not unlike Lake Sarez itself. I was able to watch via
the sattelite imaggery as the lake slowly filled, then partially
released as it broke through the top of the rubble.</p>
<p>This added a new complication: Parties before us had some rather
exciting and difficult portages along this section, and we had no idea
how the landslide would look once we got there. Would we be able to get
over it? Would the currents force us to stay far away? Could we come up
with a plan B?</p>
<p>We decided to go for it anyway, with a rather awful escape plan to
get up and out of the lake if we couldn’t scale the landslide. I was
optimistic, Megan less so. We made a large note of this in our trip plan
document as a possible snag.</p>
<h1 id="day-0">Day 0</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_0_1.jpg"></img></p>
<p>I’ll skip a lot of the standard “We lived in a Land Cruiser for a
week driving to Murghab along the Pamir Highway” stuff since this is
more of a trip report and just get right to the day before in Murghob.
We, our food, all of our gear and our optimism made it intact to 12,000
feet in the town of Murghob.</p>
<p>I had some altitude sickness the day before and spent the rest of the
afternoon and evening in bed half asleep, but Megan managed to make some
friends with a WHO crew that was up there and had a more entertaining
evening.</p>
<p>I managed to crawl out of bed to chug water and stuff twelve days of
food into my bag, and like any good adventure, it was comically heavy.
Very depressing. Luckily we’d be on water for the first 5-6 days and it
wouldn’t matter so much.</p>
<p>Somehow in the course of all this, we realized we flew out on
December 5th, and that we’d actually have two less days than we planned
to do the whole trip. So now we were already running late by two days.
We decided to just go for it anyway, front-load some miles on the first
day and move quick. We’re pretty good at suffering for long chunks of
time.</p>
<h1 id="day-1">Day 1</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_0_0.jpg"></img></p>
<p>We got up early, ate breakfast and managed to hoof everything out to
the river. The instant coffee and porridge I had were fantastic, and my
head didn’t hurt so I was feeling even better. The walk was about a
mile, and it was rough with all of the weight in the bags, but not too
bad. Locals eyed us on the way down but nobody followed us to the
river.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_1_0.jpg"></img></p>
<p>30 minutes after getting to the river and we were floating away. It
was moving quite quick, around four miles per hour, which was fantastic.
We were going to try and go ~28ish miles that day so that we could check
out the Eli Su hot springs near Modiyan.</p>
<p>The river moved quickly and so did we- lots of scenic floating,
scrubby grass, people out cutting the grass with scythes, horses, wild
cows and sheep, and eventually scrubby trees once we lost enough
elevation. M didn’t like the cheese she bought so I ended up taking it
and eating a lot of it. Twenty miles went down pretty quickly.</p>
<p>We stopped at one point while the sun was out to check out a
graveyard, small little mud buildings slowly dissolving in the harsh
climate. No names or anything, just mounds and pits or small domes. Some
locals watched us float away.</p>
<p>As the mountains rose up around us it started to feel more remote,
and we pulled off to camp around 2PM. 29 river miles down in not that
much time. I wasn’t super keen on the hot springs and there wasn’t a
clear, short path to get there so M went on her own. I had some
afternoon coffee and headed up the creek to see if it would be
paddleable. Curious locals walked by and eyed our tent but nobody said
hi.</p>
<p>I bailed after it became impossible to continue without a substantial
creek crossing and had a little adventure on the way back. I fought my
way up a super steep gully, which was very tiring at twelve thousand
feet, and then came back down a road. It had started raining at this
time so I was pretty soaked.</p>
<p>Megan didn’t get back until around 8:30, and she’d had her own
adventure. Apparently the hot springs are VERY hot and they’re basically
in someone’s home. She didn’t get in more than knee high, and it was
more like a sauna. She tried to fight her way back down the creek, but
turned back for the same reason I did, except she had another five miles
back to camp. She put in a whole 13 miles on foot and walked back in the
rain. Brutal.</p>
<p>We ate and went to bed around 9ish.</p>
<h1 id="day-2">Day 2</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_2_0.jpg"></img></p>
<p>We woke up at six, after it rained all night. This would be a theme:
Wind and rain in the afternoons and evenings. I hadn’t drank enough
water and had a headache, cool- I couldn’t really eat so I just had some
ibuprofen and drank a bunch of Megan’s earl grey tea which was amazing.
I felt like a real mountaineer. The sun was out too, so things were
looking up.</p>
<p>We pack and drag the boats up a little ways so we can drop the little
creek we slept next to, it was fun. Then we managed to convince
ourselves that the river was higher, because it was much faster and
there was a little class II- at the start. It was definitely moving
quickly, but I figured that we just burned through all the gradient for
the day. It leveled off pretty soon afterward but kept moving
nicely.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_2_2.jpg"></img> <em>One of
the side channels.</em></p>
<p>We entertained ourslves by taking small side channels and seeing if
they’d get us around a bend faster. Usually they didn’t, but they were
entertaining.</p>
<p>At one point we came upon a big, new yellow houses on the side of the
river. We tried to talk to someone there but the language barrier was
pretty thick. We couldn’t figure out what the house was there for or why
it was so big, it’s not even on google maps yet. Very suspicious.</p>
<p>At some point we pass the end of the road that had been paralleling
the river and things suddenly feel much more remote. The mountain walls
touch the water, but eerily there are on rapids. I kept expecting
something surprising to show up and grab us.</p>
<p>At some point we hang out on a gravel bar to eat and skip rocks and
look for interesting specimens. No fossils this time around, though.</p>
<p>We start passing through the landslides-of-old, and the lakes they
created, and it gets much hotter and slower. We pass a good camp spot
and decide to keep going into the newly formed lake. Trees start to be
swallowed by the water, and nothing is moving anymore. It’s very surreal
being in this steep mountain bowl with nothing but rock and
matcha-colored water all around you. Little did we know this was just an
easy predecessor of things to come.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_2_1.jpg"></img></p>
<p>Towards the later afternoon we fight our way up a canyon, dragging
boats and walking through glacial silted brush to get to a shitty
campsite. We go back and forth for quite some time about camping on a
high rocky bank covered in rockfall, or a microscopic, wet gravel
bar.</p>
<p>After examining the gravel bar (it was wet and even smaller than we
thought) we decide to go for the extremely sharp rockfall zone. We find
the least deadly spot we can and, after maybe an hour, manage to carve
out a small, smooth depression in the scree. I dubbed it Castle Quinlan.
It’s not bad but it’s not great, either.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_2_3.jpg"></img> <em>Laying
down on the only flat spot on Castle Quinlan</em></p>
<p>We eat around 5:30, get everything setup, and the rain/wind rolls in
again. This time I drink a lot of tea before bed, hoping to stave off
the headache. I read a bit of <a
href="http://livingthebestdayever.com/">Living the Best Day Ever</a>
which is now my nightly ritual. It’s very good.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the big day, we have to cross our big, unknown landslide
wall. Hopefully it doesn’t have parapets and armed guards. It doesn’t
take long for us to fall asleep.</p>
<h1 id="day-3">Day 3</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_3_0.jpg"></img> <em>Getting
ready to leave day 2 camp</em></p>
<p>It was windy and rainy all night but we were pretty comfy, despite
pitching the tent without the bug net insert. We heard rockfall
throughout the night but it was mostly across the canyon, or farther
upstream. We survived.</p>
<p>When we got up and out of the tent at six, our only alternative camp
site, the gravel bar, was under water. Good thing we moved all those
rocks around instead. We left camp by 8:30AM and headed off into the
lake. Megan was paddling with her pack balanced on the bow of her boat
in case we had to do some steep ascent to get out of the water and over
the landslide.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_3_1.jpg"></img>
<em>Bow-baggin’</em></p>
<p>After about 90 minutes and what we <em>thought</em> was a lot of
wind, we made it to the dam. We took one break about halfway through at
another landslide protruding into the water to eat and drink before
round the final corner to our unknown obstacle.</p>
<p>The first thing we noticed was that everything was covered in a fine
gray dust- it filled the whole basin. We were also pleasantly surprised
to see that our plan B would probably go if we needed it to, but it was
a steep uphill climb through a rock-filled gully. Not really ideal.</p>
<p>Luckily for us, it was easy to get out and inspect the new slide. It
was also easy to walk around on- it was completely filled in with the
same moon-dust coating the walls. We got up and looked at the water
bursting through the other side, which was as crazy as you can imagine,
then went to the boats and packed everything up for what was,
surprisingly, an easy portage.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_3_2.jpg"></img> <em>Me
somewhere in the moon field</em></p>
<p>It was only about a quarter mile or so, and it wasn’t even that bad.
We’d both been expecting way worse. We blew up again at the bottom and
boated out on the first real whitewater we’d seen in the whole trip. The
water was coming through over the dam (colored green) and through it at
the bottom (colored bright blue) and then mixing again into a blue. It
was very pretty, and wildly different than the dirty green from up above
the dam.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_3_3.jpg"></img> <em>Packing
back up to paddle away from the dam.</em></p>
<p>We briefly lost eachother after I stopped to take some photos of
Megan paddling out, but then joined back up for some fast-moving water
through flooded brush fields. A pleasant float after paddling hard on
the lake for a while.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_3_4.jpg"></img> <em>Megan
paddles out on some busy class II after the portage</em></p>
<p>We stopped to investigate some rusty things we saw along the shore
and ended up wandering around the abandoned hydrometeorological station
for a while. I don’t have any good photos of this since I only had my
GoPro, but Megan got a ton- it was like everyone just up &amp; left
after the collapse of the soviet union. Everything was bent and twisted
and full of silt like it had been flooded. I talked Megan out of keeping
one of the cool little brown bottles we found after she picked one up
that still had mercury in it. I’m pretty sure there was asbestos around
the pipes, too. A cool place, but spooky.</p>
<p>After eating something and putting back on the river, we started
noticing weird, blackened walls that looked like they had slid or
something- only after seeing them repeatedly did we realize they were
just the dirty ends of glaciers. It was really, really cool to paddle
right next to them</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_3_5.jpg"></img> <em>Looking
at a crazy scimitar-shaped iceberg in the middle of the river.</em></p>
<p>From there we had some bigger rapids, maybe class III+ and we
portaged a bigger IVish drop that snuck up on us. A big IV around a
corner had us stop for the evening in a big flat-ish bank with some good
boulders to hide behind should the rockfall fairy visit in the night. It
had been a very full day.</p>
<p>Camp was almost perfect, but the wind kicked up so the one time we
wanted to have a fire ended up being a hide-in-the-tent night. I spent
the evening drinking coffee, reading and moving rocks around the edge of
the tent to try and hide from the wind.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_3_6.jpg"></img></p>
<h1 id="day-4">Day 4</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_4_0.jpg"></img></p>
<p>The weather was beautiful in the morning, and it was great to watch
the sun creep down the canyon walls. I memorized a line through the big
rapid and decided to run it, and M found an okay put-in just afterward.
I aced my line and we were soon on our way, leaving one of the better
camp-spots. It felt good to work a harder rapid on a remote trip and
have it turn out exactly how I expected it to. It would end up being the
hardest rapid on the trip.</p>
<p>From there we had around five miles of read-and-run class III rapids
with some bigger holes, but it tapered off after the big rapid we’d
camped at. The scenery was mostly blue water, dustland, some green grass
and scrubby trees.</p>
<p>Another landslide showed up and blocked our view of what sounded like
a big rapid, so we ended up portaging it. This would be the last rapid
before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarez_Lake">lake</a>,
and we paused to eat for a while. After snacking for a bit, we ran the
run out and started paddling down the lake.</p>
<p>I was optimistic that we could build a raft out of driftwood and the
packrafts to hopefully gain some speed since there were sticks
everywhere, but I’d later realize that there were only sticks at this
end of the lake because thats where the wind pushed them.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_4_1.jpg"></img></p>
<p>We paddled for ages. The wind picked up in the afternoon and it only
got way worse. We stopped once for a potential campspot because the
going was so rough, and M wanted to bail for a highroute but I convinced
her to keep going. After that the wind <em>really</em> picked up and
<em>I</em> wanted to bail, but she convinced me to keep going.</p>
<p>It’s hard to overstate how bad the wind and the rain were. They
absolutely whipped us going around corners. I could go a little faster
than M so I was making oh, 1 mile per hour? She was somewhere under
that. It was insane. We’d paddle from wall to wall along the lake,
hardly moving at all, then a gust would hit us and we’d shelter, then
we’d hide in a little eddie, then do it all over again. It was very slow
going.</p>
<p>Eventually we spotted land we could potentially get up onto (since
the walls are so steep), but a beach surprised us before we even got
there. We arrived on this fantastic beach around 7:00pm, and
<em>immediately</em> upon landing the wind stopped and the lake was
glassy. The clouds cleared. We could see all the 6000 meter peaks around
us, with fresh snow on top. It was savage, and we were absolutely
tired.</p>
<p>We ate and went to bed. We slept well until the tent partially
collapsed and I had to walk around in the dark looking for rocks to prop
everything back up.</p>
<h1 id="day-5">Day 5</h1>
<p><img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_5_0.jpg"></img> <em>Morning
on our little miracle beach. Notice fresh snow in the mountain
tops.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps traumatised by our awful, million-hour paddle from the day
before, Megan suggested we wake up at 4AM. While we were awake earlier,
we were also a little slower in leaving camp and didn’t head out until
around 7AM.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_5_1.jpg"></img></p>
<p>We paddled all day. It wasn’t bad at first, just a big treadmill with
a minor headwind and clear skies, but it got bad later. Megan’s boat
paddles like a sheet of plywood, so it was much more tiring to move. We
passed the time with 20 questions, I spy, and other little games. I even
came up with a little song I’ve already forgotten.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_5_2.jpg"></img></p>
<p>We paddled and stopped a few times for snacks or Peanut Butter
Tortillas. There weren’t any great places to stop, just shallow little
sand pits on the side of screen slopes. We tried not to linger as rocks
and dirt slid down around us.</p>
<p>I was frustrated, Megan was in pain, and times were rough, but we
made it through eventually. We found a weird little nook and managed to
scramble up to a plateau, where we ate in the sun and decided to call it
for the day despite not having gone super far. We kept double-guessing
the decision when the lake would go flat, but decided there was no other
place to camp in the near future. 7AM to 2PM isn’t too bad, right?</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_5_3.jpg"></img> <em>Megan
lounging on the perfect boulder</em></p>
<p>It turned out to be a good spot, and we spent the evening wandering
around looking at small rocks. Megan found a really cool little crystal,
and we decided to pitch the tent on the ridge despite the wind picking
up later. It was an absolute pain to haul everything up there, but we
were thankful for the flat ground. I somehow managed to spill my dinner
onto the ground, but it was still dry so I managed to get every single
dehydrated noodle back into the bag.</p>
<p>We were in bed by 6:15PM.</p>
