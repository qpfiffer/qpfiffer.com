I'm getting out of the game, and I'm selling this MR2. Heres what I've got, maybe you want to buy it?</p>
<h1 id="what-it-is">What it is</h1>
<p>A naturally-asperated 1985 Toyota MR2. This is <em>not</em> the supercharged edition. Has a moonroof. Manual doorlocks/windows. Cruise control. Manual transmission.</p>
<p>I bought the car for $400 dollars (rod knock) off of craigslist with the intention of turning it into a badass rally machine/gambler car. I got about halfway through and ran out of money and time. It's time for it to go.</p>
<p>The engine and transmission have been removed, along with the rear brakes (they were seizing up and I had to take them off so we could roll it into the garage.</p>
<p>It's basically a build-your-own race-car kit. The title is clean, but unregistered: I have all previous bills of sale between the last title and now.</p>
<h1 id="what-i-have">What I have</h1>
<h2 id="the-big-stuff">The Big Stuff</h2>
<ul>
<li>One stock transmission (the C50)</li>
<li>One 3-rib 4AGE engine block + head + all the fixings (came out of this car)</li>
<li>One 7-rib 4AGE engine block + head + all the fixings. This one came out of a 1989 MR2 and both the head and block have been cleaned and remachined. The block has been overbored by .020&quot;, if I remember correctly. I have the paperwork for both of these chunks of work and they were done by Ted King from Portland Engine Rebuilders. I can provide more detail here if necessary.</li>
<li>Eight wheels: Four stock, four random aluminum garbage ones that came with the car when I bought it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<ul>
<li>Random stock exhaust</li>
<li>The car has four adjustable strut inserts, I'm not sure of the brand. I've never pulled them. Maybe someone can tell from the pictures of the top?</li>
<li>Exhaust wrap: I've got a roll of it and if the car goes I have no use for it.</li>
<li>I have a shitton of pistons and rods, for some reason. Both the stock ones, and the overbored ones. Brand new.</li>
<li>Brand new gasket kit. (timing belt, head gasket, etc.)</li>
<li>New oil pump</li>
<li>New water pump</li>
<li>All the screws/bolts/nuts/linkages are mostly sorted into small containers.</li>
<li>New hose kit (All silicon hoses)</li>
<li>Two new LED lamps and the needed inverter relays. Theres even an extra relay because I didn't know you only needed one.</li>
<li><strong>Yes, the headlights still go up and down.</strong></li>
<li>A/C compressor of unknown status</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are small rust spots in the body, but it's a west coast car as far as I know so it's not totally destroyed underneath.</li>
<li>There is a small crack in the exhaust manifold.</li>
<li>At some point whatever battery was in the car corroded, so there are some corrded/rusty spots on the battery mount plate, the top of the transmission and what I think is the heater core.</li>
<li>A <em>lot</em> of the internal parts are covered with oil/muck, mostly the lower ones. Things like the fuel rails, MAF, throttle-body are all pretty clean.</li>
<li>When pulling the exhaust, I managed to de-weld one of the exhaust hook hangars. It was a little bolt spot-welded into a hole in the body. I think it's still rattling around in there but shouldn't be a big deal.</li>
<li>Theres mouse-poop in the trunk: I had to pull out all of the fabric in there when I bought the car so it's largely empty.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-is-it">Where is it</h2>
<p>The one super annoying thing is that both engines and a few parts are here in PDX, but the car itself is out in Scappoose in a hangar. It'll need to be trailered to go anywhere useful, but the engines can be grabbed here in Portland.</p>
