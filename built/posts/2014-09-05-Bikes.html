On the other hand, today was pretty busy.</p>
<p>I started off with a trip to the National Taiwan Musem, which wasn't much, to be honest. There were some <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/104820964@N07/15145535052/">neat things</a> though.</p>
<p>After that, I followed it up with a trip out to and on to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maokong_Gondola">Maokong Gondoloa</a> which was a nice little experience. It was incredibly hot in the actual... gondolites? Gondolas? gondominiums? I don't know, it only cost me 50 NTD and I bought ice cream at the end.</p>
<p>Got home, hung out on my computer for a while, then I played more street fighter, and surprise surprise the <a href="http://www.razerzone.com/capcomprotour-asia/">capcom pro-tour is coming to Taiwan tomorrow</a>, and I'm gonna hit that up. I've become quite chummy with the dudes at the arcade despite the language barrier. I got one of their LINE numbers or whatever it is, and we fight pretty often. Good group of dudes.</p>
<p>After losing a bunch of money to some Blanka player, I went out and ordered yakisoba. This was a fun little outing too because I added an egg to the meal, which I haven't done before. This resulted in some back and forth with them asking me how I wanted my egg done. I don't know the words for that so I eventually just said I don't care and we moved on. Fun guys, they were all smiling about it.</p>
<p>After that I ran back to the hostel and grabbed my camera because the <a href="https://zh-tw.facebook.com/FIXEDSTYLETEAM">Taiwan Fixed-Style meetup</a> happens every Friday night and I like bikes, so.</p>
<p>I got there and there are some <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/104820964@N07/14961570030/">pretty nice bikes</a> at this thing, makes me realize I should probably put together a new one. Some nice kids ended up approaching me for some kind of pseudo art-project where I answer a question on a postcard and then ask one of my own, which will then show up whenever it's shipped. Really cool actually.</p>
<p>Finally I ended up chatting with one guy for a while until everyone took off on their ride, I really regret not being able to take my bike; it would've been fun.</p>
