Or a series of posts. In
2018 I left for SE Asia on an extended trip. We departed the US on
September 26th, and didn’t return until March 3rd 2019. I went with
Megan, my ex-coworker/training partner/roommate/girlfriend, and we spent
a total of 165 days together. Heres a bit about what we did in each
country, the lessons learned, and whatever else I can think of.</p>
<h2 id="usa">USA</h2>
<p><img src="/static/img/se_asia_2018_2019/backpack.jpg"></img></p>
<p>Before we even left, we did a ton of preparation. I’ve never lived
out of a backpack before, we had to get Pakistani visas, we needed to
book a 10-day silent meditation retreat in Myanmar (Burma?), etc. So
there was a lot of stuff to do.</p>
<p>The days and weeks before we left were pretty hectic in general, I
was <a href="https://obra.org/m/people/136287/2018">racing bikes</a> or
<a href="http://q.pfiffer.org/posts/2018-08-15-Outback_2018">riding
them</a> for extended periods of time and Megan was out on all sorts of
adventures. We prepared spordaically, but with quite a bit of
detail.</p>
<p>We’d spend hours in coffee shops poring over blog posts, Lonely
Planet guides and a loose collection of plans that Megan had made with
friends. In the end, we came up with the following itinerary, which we
sort of stuck to:</p>
<pre><code>Country # of days - estimate
Pakistan    14
UAE (Dubai) 4
Nepal   31
Myanmar 28
Thailand    21?
Malaysia?   5? (in the middle, while climbing south)
Laos    10
Vietnam 14
Cambodia    7?
Indonesia + Bali    10-14
Add Phillipines 7 days?</code></pre>
<p>We used google sheets to plan out all of this stuff. We also had
things like vaccinations, guides to book, what visas we needed to get
ahead of time, travel insurance, an unused gear list, that kind of
thing. It was really all over the place.</p>
<p>We also spent a lot of time on <a href="">Couchsurfing</a>, trying to
find places to stay. This is an exhausting process as well, but pretty
rewarding. We found a host family to stay with in Lahore, and another
guy to stay with in Dubai (which would end up being kind of a mistake).
You have to respond to EVEREYONE, and we used Megan’s profile, so there
were a lot of people to respond to. There was more than one late night
just saying “Thanks for your offer but no thanks” to a couple dozen
people.</p>
<p>The hardest part of the pre-planning was getting visas for Pakistan.
It’s not really easy to get in, and to even be considered for entry you
have to book a full tour with a company willing to sponsor you for the
whole time. We ended up going with <a
href="http://adventureguide.com.pk">Alpine Adveture Guides</a> at the
behest of one of Megan’s climbing friends. They’re incredibly solid,
kind people and the head of the company, Ali Saltoro, was key in getting
our visas through. Turns out he knows just about everybody.</p>
<p>In the end we were pretty confident, but theres always more you can
do. At some point you just have to get on the plane.</p>
<h2 id="guangzhou-china">Guangzhou, China</h2>
<p>We boarded our first plane on the 26th, headed to Vancouver, B.C. for
short layover, and then after a ~13 hour flight arrived in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>. We had a
12 hour layover or something, so we decided to go out and explore the
city. This was perfect, because Megan doesn’t have a visa. I have one
already from my other trips to China, so it was easy for me to get
through immigration.</p>
<p>We wandered around, drank coffee at a small cafe, checked out the
weird underwear street, and tried not to feel exhausted. We tried to
meet up with someone from <a
href="https://www.couchsurfing.com">Couchsurfing</a>, but that fell
through. It would’ve been really cool to experience the city with a
local, but oh well.</p>
<p>Theres not a whole lot to say about China. I’ve done it before, and
most of the cities feel the same. It was really fun to go through it
with Megan though, who has never been.</p>
<h2 id="pakistan">Pakistan</h2>
<p><img src="/static/img/se_asia_2018_2019/pakistan_general.jpg"></img></p>
<p>Towards the end of the day in China, we boarded a plane to Lahore. I
immediately lost my headphones, credit and debit cards. Hilarious. I
didn’t notice, either, for a while. Luckily when you travel with someone
else who is paying attention, they can pay for everything.</p>
<p>After a sort of long flight (maybe six hours or so?) we end up in
Lahore in the early evening. It was hot, dirty and nuts. Our host, Ali,
picked us up in a comically small car. Like barely big enough for our
backpacks, us, and Ali. It took us 45 minutes to get out of the parking
lot. Megan and I just sat and tried to absorb it, while making small
talk with Ali. He’s a mountaineer and has spent some time up in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgit-Baltistan">the north</a>, so
it was easy to have some common ground.</p>
<p>That first night we were just exhausted, but still stayed up way too
late. It seems to be part of the culture over there to stay up late,
which is odd because <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/opinion/pakistan-has-a-drinking-problem.html">drinking
is outlawed.</a> I think Megan hadn’t slept the night before we’d left
the US, either, so she was especially exhausted.</p>
<h3 id="lahore">Lahore</h3>
<p><img src="/static/img/se_asia_2018_2019/lahorse_get_it.jpg"></img></p>
<p>Our host family in Lahore was great, and very kind. We stayed in a
room all to ourselves up on the third floor of a house that seemed
dead-center in the maze that is Lahore. We shared a single towel, which
for some reason was really common on the rest of the trip.</p>
<p>We went to old Lahore (feels like something out of Aladdin), visited
a few mosques (where they made Megan wear a longer skirt and a
head-cover) and just tried to soak it all in. Traffic is crazy, everyone
is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalwar_kameez">wearing the
same thing</a>, and we were stared at a lot. It was harmless staring,
but tourists are so rare, even in a huge city like Lahore, that we were
fascinating. Very few made the effort to talk to us though, but a few
women approached us in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa">full burqa</a> for
selfies.</p>
<p>I have only good things to say about our host family. They were kind,
treated us to a few meals (homecooked or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_street">otherwise</a>) and were
great for conversation. We learned a ton about local culture and the
history of Pakistan, and got some good beta for our upcoming trip to the
north.</p>
<p>Lahore was one of our most culture-shock cities. Our jetlag really
didn’t help, and we both remember being so exhausted on the second night
that we were actively falling asleep. Our hosts took us out to dinner at
like 1 in the morning, and we were absolutely dead. I remember watching
Megan fall asleep in the car on the way over. It would’ve been rude but
it was just so funny how tired we were, we couldn’t help but laugh</p>
<h3 id="islamabad">Islamabad</h3>
<p><img src="/static/img/se_asia_2018_2019/islamabad_climbing.jpg"></img></p>
<p>We’d spent only three days in Lahore, but that was more than enough
for us. We headed to the airport towards the end of our stay and, after
saying goodbye to our hosts, boarded a plane to Islamabad.</p>
<p>The airport was much nicer, and we eventually found our guide. Ali
Saltoro himself, who was to be our guide for the next two weeks, picked
us up and we made our way out. Megan liked him immediately because of
how fast he walked. They got along great.</p>
<p>After paying Ali (we’d messed up and brought Pakistani money, which
is so volatile it lost much of it’s value before we even entered the
country) via wire transfer, we ran and climbed. Ali took us around town,
getting Megan a more acceptable shirt to wear, we had dinner and hit up
an artifical climbing wall. We also <a
href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1877315150">ran a bit</a> in the
heat, which was a nightmare. There were salt lines all over me.</p>
<p>Our time in Islamabad was supposed to be short, but they’d cancelled
our flight to Skardu, so we had an extra day. We passed the time by <a
href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1881565520">running in the
Margala hills</a> and Ali showed his ability to adapt by getting us out
climbing in the hills. We met a really kind speed/sport climber who
belayed us and showed us some routes. Climbing in the sun sucks, but
it’s still climbing.</p>
<p>Islamabad wasn’t my favorite place, but everyone we met was very
kind. It also continued the theme of there being trash
<strong>everywhere</strong>. It’s really hard to believe unless you see
it first hand, but both Lahore and Islamabad were filthy. Lahore more
so, but Islamabad had a couple of little streams and small villages on
the outskirts of town which would just collect trash. It was
heart-breaking to see it all there and no one doing anything about
it.</p>
<h2 id="skardu">Skardu</h2>
<p><img src="/static/img/se_asia_2018_2019/skardu.jpg"></img></p>
<p>After too long in Islamabad, we flew out to Skardu. Skardu is
beautiful, and after a stressful morning of being almost too late for
the flight, it was breath-taking to see the huge, stark mountains
everywhere. We saw K2 and Gasherbrum 1 (I think) on the way in, poking
out over the cloud cover.</p>
<p>We got setup at the famous <a
href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g317119-d8325097-Reviews-PTDC_K2_Motel_Skardu-Skardu_Gilgit_Baltistan.html">K2
Hotel</a> and went on a pretty big run. We checked out the Skardu fort
and Organic Village, and got forced into a million different selfies
with these two guys. It wasn’t bad, just funny. We picked a few slightly
transparent rocks out of the river bed as souvenirs.</p>
<p>On the way back into town we met this guy and started talking to him
and he invited us over for dinner. Turns out he’s a hotel/museum owner
(weird combo, but okay). We sent a weird message to our guide sort of
explaining where we were going, and went and had dinner with this guy.
He told us a lot about the area, gave us free dinner and was in general
a good host. His Gilgit-Baltistan relics were pretty fun to explore,
too.</p>
<p>Later in the night <a
href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bpzlt8kFjNA/">our driver</a> from
earlier in the day showed up out of nowhere and took us home. Thats when
we learned Ali is kind of a gangster - he looked our host up by his
phone number, found where he lives and sent the driver for us. It was
kind of scary, Megan pointed out it was like our parents had picked us
up from a party we weren’t supposed to be going to. Everything was fine,
however, just kind of funny.</p>
<p>The next day we embarked on our long drive. We’d spend the next <a
href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bpzlt8kFjNA/">ten days or so in a
Landcruiser</a>. It’s a pretty fun, spicy way to see a place. We
traversed lots of tundra, had milktea at small outposts in the middle of
nowhere, and took a lot of good pictures.</p>
<h2 id="nanga-parbat-tarashing-village">Nanga Parbat (Tarashing
Village)</h2>
<p><img src="/static/img/se_asia_2018_2019/nenga_parbat.jpg"></img></p>
<p>Nenga Parbat is a pretty famous <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanga_Parbat">8000 meter peak</a> in
the himalaya. Since we’re budding young mountaineers and Ali is an
Alpine guide, our entire tour consisted mostly of visiting mountainous,
out-there places. Nenga Parbat did not dissapoint, and I got some of my
favorite pictures on the trip from the glacier on the Rupal-face side.
When the mountain wasn’t covered by clouds, it was majestic. We spent a
couple nights at it’s base, exploring the glacier and the small village
there. The land cruiser ride out there was pretty crazy, too.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, it was my first time at some real elevation and we
got up to 12,000 feet for a day. Later, in Nepal, this would feel
amazing, but for that day it was pretty tough.</p>
<p>We spent our evenings eating in the dim light of solar-powered LEDs
and playing this card game that Ali taught us. Megan would get pretty
good at it, and I started keeping score eventually. I believe Ali and
Megan would eventually tie for lifetime-points over the course of the
trip.</p>
<h2 id="hunza-valley-karimabad">Hunza Valley (Karimabad)</h2>
<p><img src="/static/img/se_asia_2018_2019/hunza.jpg"></img></p>
<p>The drive from Tarashing to the place we would end up staying in
Hunza was pretty eventful. We stopped at <a
href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hussaini-hanging-bridge">the
world’s most dangerous bridge</a> and detoured to check out the <a
href="https://www.dangerousroads.org/asia/pakistan/2655-khunjerab-pass.html">world’s
highest border crossing.</a> We listened to Justin Bieber and Taylor
Swift a lot on the way down from there, because for some reason the Land
Cruiser had a lot of music videos built into this tiny dashboard TV. It
was a busy day.</p>
<p>Our hotel in Karimabad was incredible, and definitely had the best
view of our stay in Pakistan. Pictures don’t really come close to
conveying how insane the 360 degree view was, but it was
indescribable.</p>
<p>We visited the Altit fort, went for <a
href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1890248572">a run out and
back</a> and in general just enjoyed the place. We didn’t stay long.</p>
<p>It should be noted that this whole area is beautiful, the rivers are
incredible blue and fierce, and there are mountains dominating the
countryside everywhere. The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karakoram_Highway">Karakoram
Highway</a> cuts through these mountains, and is in a constant state of
disrepair because of it. Rockfall destroys the roads constantly, and
you’re always seeing crews removing large stones from the middle of the
road. The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck_art_in_South_Asia">psychedelic
trucks</a> and buses don’t seem to mind, though.</p>
<h2 id="fairy-meadows-nanga-parbat">Fairy Meadows, Nanga Parbat</h2>
<p><img src="/static/img/se_asia_2018_2019/fairy_meadows.jpg"></img></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve never seen Megan so excited about French Fries” - October 9th,
2018</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We circled back around to Nanga Parbat, this time the Rakhiot face.
Getting there was pretty crazy- We drove and drove, then we parked the
car and got into these really old 70s-era Landrcuiser Jeeps that are
patched together with whatever is lying around, and you enjoy a “1-Hour
exciting jeep journey” to a village two hours away from the fairy
meadows. The tires on all of these jeeps are super bald, and the roadway
to the top is just enough to allow one of them to pass. The drivers are
always honking around corners just in case someone is coming the other
way.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/se_asia_2018_2019/jeep.jpg"></img></p>
<p>At some point we stopped, the driver got out and we all looked down
into this crazy valley at the wreckage of a jeep. Apparently, just days
prior, part of the road had washed out and a jeep had gone down. A bunch
of people died, since there are like 8-10 of you packed into a single
jeep, and a few more were injured. Pretty sobering. Pakistan is
intense.</p>
<p>After a two hour hike at the end of the day (my first with a real
backpack and pretty miserable) we arrived in the dark at our lodge,
which was incredible. The Pakistani are pretty resourceful, and it
seemed like the whole lodge was basically built with chainsaws and grit.
What they couldn’t build, they carried up in flip-flops. It was
supremely peaceful.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/se_asia_2018_2019/cards.jpg"></img></p>
<p>We stayed up there for a few days, hiking up towards basecamp and
exploring the area. At some point in the night it snowed, so we were
stuck up there in the cold. We enjoyed the wood stove and tried to stay
warm. We played a lot of cards with Ali. We <a
href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1900428266">explored the upper
area</a> on the hike to basecamp, and played around in the snow. We even
got into some <a
href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1900427834">sketchy
bushwhacking</a>.</p>
<p>The food there was pretty good, we ate a lot of french fries that
were hand cut. Breakfasts were definitely my favorite; <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapati">chapati</a> fried in oil is
amazing. Especially with milk-tea and these really good little flat
omelletes.</p>
<p>Sleeping up there was kind of difficult, elevation does weird things
to you. I’d later learn in Nepal that you sleep better after
acclimatizing (duh), but I’d end up gasping myself awake a lot. We
weren’t even up that high, either. Maybe like ten or eleven thousand
feet.</p>
<p>Eventually hiked down and out, through the snow and onto another
jeep. We’d run out of time and our flight back was the next day so we
had to get moving.</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/se_asia_2018_2019/snowman.jpg"></img></p>
<h2 id="back-to-islamabad">Back to Islamabad</h2>
<p>The worst part of the whole Pakistan trip was getting back to
Islamabad. Ali hired a different driver, because Ahmed (our driver) had
to go back to Skardu. We missed Ahmed and his big smile immediately.</p>
<p>The drive back to Islamabad was terrible; exhaust fumes kept getting
into the car so Megan and I just got sicker and sicker as the 17 hour
car ride went on. Not to mention weird tensions between Ali and the
driver. We all felt so shitty and tired we stopped and spent like two
hours at the worst hotel you can imagine. I was so dead I just
immediately passed out.</p>
<p>We drove through the night and eventually made it back to the guest
house in Islamabad that we had stayed in before and caught a couple of
hours sleep. I’ll never forget seeing the driver with his head on the
wheel at the end of the journey; poor guy.</p>
<p>We flew out the next day after having some final tea and saying
goodbye to Ali. Onto Dubai!</p>
