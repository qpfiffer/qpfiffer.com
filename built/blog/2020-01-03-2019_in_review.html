===============</p><p>Where do I even start? I'm tired just thinking about it.
<h3>General</h3></p><p><ul><li>One big thing I've started doing is that on every trip we go on now, I started</li></ul>
  a "Lessson for X 20YY", and just write down everything I learned, experienced
  or want to look up. I end up with great quotes, bookes to read, lessons that
  are invaluable, etc. They all go in one place and they're really easy to look
  back on.
<ul><li>My guitar playing is getting there. It's such a fun, productive activity. A</li></ul>
  little bit every day with no plan is more than enough to really make me feel
  like I'm investing in it.
<ul><li>Started logging all/most of my transactions. I started out using an app on</li></ul>
  our trip, which carried over to home life, which eventually has led to
<a href=https://www.youneedabudget.com/>YNAB</a> which I'm still getting used to.
<ul><li>Got two jobs.</li><li>Didn't have enough money to pay taxes when we got back from Asia so I had to</li></ul>
  go on an installment plan. That sucked. You owe WAY more when thats over.
<ul><li>I sewed a bit- a couple bike bags, mostly.</li><li>Learned a lot about communication and what works well for me and having</li></ul>
  emotionally heavy conversations.
<ul><li>My <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/B3NWF0-Fmpl/>car was stolen.</a></li><li>We did the <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/BzVysz0lN8L/>Gambler 500</a> again.</li><li>Visited Grandma!</li><li>Went to Kentucky for like, a day.</li></ul>
<h3>Racing/Bikes</h3></p><p><ul><li><a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/BzJGB3iFQAy/>Repainted my track bike</a> in Dazzle camo.</li><li>Had a <a href=http://q.pfiffer.org/posts/2019-05-12-Emerald_Outback_2019>TERRIBL(y great) TIME</a> at the Oregon Emerald Outback. The mental</li></ul>
  toughness that I acquired coming out of that trip was amazing. I didn't care
  about physical pain, or cold, or being hungry, or too hot or sweaty or
  dehydrated- it was all fine.
<ul><li>Did <a href=https://www.strava.com/activities/2272744480>white rim in a day.</a></li><li>Had my <a href=https://www.strava.com/activities/2353171792>biggest single push</a></li></ul>
  ever, at 160 miles.
<ul><li><a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/B2P6CqOl5_L/>Red Bull Bay Climb!</a> I qualified</li></ul>
  but that was it. Neat event.
<ul><li>Did my first Alpenrose Velodrome Challenge but it was a pretty bad turnout and</li></ul>
  I hadn't raced all season due to the fucked up arm. Kinda sad.
<h3>Adventure</h3></p><p><ul><li>Ran my own solo <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/BzCUF11F3XA/>50k around Mt. St.  Helens</a></li><li>Ran two ultramarathons, one was <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/B2EnNUalevW/>The RUT</a> and the other was <a href=https://gobeyondracing.com/races/lastest-not-fastest/>Lastest not Fastest</a>. It was a monster year of foot racing, for some reason.</li><li>Did my first orienteering race (super fun, definitely want to do more)</li><li>Two new sports: Skiing and Ice Climbing. I'm pretty stoked on ice climbing I</li></ul>
  think.
<ul><li>My <a href=http://q.pfiffer.org/posts/2019-08-29-Camping_plus_others_megamix>packing lists</a> are getting really dialed in.</li><li>The summer was kind of a wash because I broke my arm.</li><li>Got PADI certified and went on 10 dives, 8 in Bali and 2 in the Phillipines.</li><li>Did a solo <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/BvpKEygFpYS/>bikerafting</a> adventure. That was hilariously bad, but amazing.</li><li>First ski tour, first ice climb, first hut-to-hut multi-day ski tour: Winter</li></ul>
  sports abound.
<h3>Climbing</h3></p><p><ul><li>Climbed sport in Tonsai (Thailand), Laos, Cat Ba (Vietnam), Hong Kong and the Phillipines.</li><li>Redpointed my hardest climb ever in the Phillipines.</li><li>Learned how to <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/BwTbfe9FsPa/>crack climb in Indian Creek</a>, and in Moab (Wall Street)</li><li>Climbed Mt. Hood</li><li>Climbed in the Gunks and the Adirondacks</li><li>Climbed in Red Rocks (Vegas)</li></ul>
<h3>Packrafting</h3></p><p><ul><li>Survived [Westwater Canyon]() with just Megan - we probably shouldn't have done</li></ul>
  this. Way too dangerous with just the two of us.
<ul><li>Did part of <a href=https://www.strava.com/activities/2235734434>Hood River</a> without</li></ul>
  swimming. Would have been COLD.
<ul><li>Had some scary swims at the <a href=https://packraft.org/work/packraft-roundup/>American Packrafting Roundup</a> where I <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/B0Pj9xqFhw7/>broke a</li></ul>
  paddle.</a>
<h3>Strength/Fitness</h3></p><p><ul><li>SO MUCH RUNNNING! I broke my arm and that was pretty much it. Tempo runs,</li></ul>
  uphill workouts, mountain objectives, Mt. Defiance, Helens, Big Sky, all sorts
  of stuff. The worst run of the year was definitely this <a href=https://www.strava.com/activities/2552815575>Stack Rock run</a> in the heat. I thought I was gonna pass out.
<ul><li>Definitely climbing better than I ever have, pre- and post-break. I'm leading</li></ul>
  in the gym and led quite a bit outside in the beginning of the year. Still now
  trad or ice yet.
<ul><li>There were a ton of big days, so I'm definitely an endurance athlete now. My</li></ul>
  bodyweight is hovering around 150lbs. I'm not afraid of 12-14 hour pushes yet,
  still haven't broken the 24 hour barrier but I imagine that'll be soon.
<h3>Books</h3></p><p>I think Gideon the Ninth was my book of the year- I couldn't put it down. Harry
August was a close second. Also finally read Patrick Rothfuss and couldn't put
any of his books down either. Not as great a turn-out as last year.</p><p><ul><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation:_Stories>Exhalations</a></li><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Fifteen_Lives_of_Harry_August>The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August</a></li><li><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/42036538-gideon-the-ninth>Gideon the Ninth</a></li><li><a href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001C4QYGC/>Kiss or Kill</a> - Mark Twight</li></ul>
<h3>Code</h3></p><p>Not a whole lot to speak of: A couple Oleg commits, some waifu stuff,
pdxburritoreview, my own resume, just random things. Some Voidcrash work that I
don't want to talk about yet.</p><p>Side-Projects
=============</p><p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/qpfiffer/pdxburritoreview.com>pdxburritoreview.com</a> -</li></ul>
  Pretty much exactly what it sounds like.</p><p>Regrets
=======</p><p><ul><li>I didn't handle breaking my arm very well. I didn't utilize the time and I was</li></ul>
just kind of in a funk for a month or two. It wasn't ideal.
<ul><li>I didn't read as much as I wanted, surprise surprise.</li><li>Bad journalling year, except for the travel sections. I'm okay with this right</li></ul>
  now since the documentation is good in other places, but it's nice to have a
  written account.</p><p>Goals from Last Year
