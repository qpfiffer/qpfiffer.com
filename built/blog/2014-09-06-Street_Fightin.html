participate in the <a href=http://www.razerzone.com/capcomprotour-asia/taiwan>Capcom Asia Pro-tour tournament.</a></p><p>After some coffee and a donut, I made my way out to the random internet/board
game cafe thing that was hosting it and signed up. Since I'd gotten there really
early I went and hung out in a cafe for a while and <a href=https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/xriJWW7p>fucked around on irc for a
while</a>.</p><p>After meeting some of my arcade friends (who knew you could bond with random
people over a video game in a foreign county?) we went up for some <a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/104820964@N07/14970120018/>casuals</a>.
Daigo, Xian, Humanbomb, Lapchi Duong, Gamerbee and a handful of other really
good international players were there to kick ass.</p><p>When the tournament finally started I was in pool A, and my first match went
really well. My second match was kind of close and after that I got my ass kicked by
some random taiwanese Ibuki player. Going 2-1 is about average for my tournament
record.</p><p>I hung out some more, ate some random bread with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rousong>pork
floss</a> (So thats what that shit is!) and
waited for the next set of pools to start.</p><p>Some of my friends did pretty well, one went as far as 4-2, which is really
good. He even said it was his first tournament! Crazy. I should've brought my
stick.</p><p>At some point I ended up chatting with the owner of the cafe thing, a starcraft
player. His english was really good, and he, like everyone else so far, said I
was dumb for just sitting in Taipei for so long. Yeah, yeah I'll get around
eventually.</p><p>After the second set of pools was over we ended up going to McDonalds. Fun
little chat, whatever. I also met a Japanese guy who said he was a fan of Daigo.</p><p>After a pretty exciting top 8, they held a raffle where I ended up winning a
shirt. It's a pretty cool looking thing, stereotypical black-on-green razer
stuff.</p><p>First rule in life is to just show up, right?</p><p></p></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'olegdbblog';(function() {var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true;dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js';(document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);})();</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href="http://disqus.com" class="dsq-brlink">comments powered by <span class="logo-disqus">Disqus</span></a></div></div></div>
