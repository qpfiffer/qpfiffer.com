ready and whatever we headed out to central.</p><p><ul><li>First time seeing central was intense. People, cars, smog, sound. People just</li></ul>
  unloading stuff in the street.
<ul><li>Had some difficulty with the map, couldn't figure out how to get to statue</li></ul>
  square for a bit.
<ul><li>Managed to figure out that staying up on the sky bridge is the best way to get</li></ul>
  around. It's pretty much a pathway that connects all of the buildings.
<ul><li>Wandered into the square, started following the guidebooks directions.</li><li>Tried to get to the 43rd floor of the HSBC tower, they didn't really like</li></ul>
  that.
<ul><li>Hong Kong park was awesome, there is a big tower with a spiral staircase that</li></ul>
  I climbed up and snapped a few pictures from.
<ul><li>Visited a random Aviary that we found.</li><li>Came back, went to the IFC mall. After struggling we found where we wanted to</li></ul>
  eat, some noodle-ish place called Tasty. Pretty cheap, good food. We didn't
get big portions but I think it was a place where you were supposed to order a
lot of dishes and share them.
<ul><li>Found an observation deck, took some pictures. The air here is pretty damn</li></ul>
  bad. Humidity wasn't terrible today.
<ul><li>Went to Mong Kok, holy shit it is crowded. People and shops and cars</li></ul>
  everywhere. Very dense.
<ul><li>Went to the Golden Computer Shopping Arcade</li><li>Wandered around the flea markets and day market areas for a bit, picked up a</li></ul>
  sim card for $3.00. I'm not quite sure what I can do with it.
<ul><li>Found the place I was looking for, Keyboard Hell. It's a mechanical keyboard</li></ul>
  store. Wasn't open so I didn't get to check out all of the prices, but it
seemed about the same as online.
<ul><li>By this point we were both tired so we headed back to out hotel. Going to rest</li></ul>
  and maybe eat or something.</p><p>Observations:</p><p><ul><li>People in the morning looooove their newspapers.</li><li>The morning rush is insane</li><li>There are hardly any pigeons. I think I saw one.</li><li>Cellphones eeeeeeverywhere</li><li>Octopus card is probably the best thing in this county. You can charge it up,</li></ul>
  check it, use it anyway (we bought some drinks with it for like 85 cents)
<ul><li>There is a lot of garbage being peddled in Sham Shui Po. Things like you'd</li></ul>
  find in the dollar tree or the cell phone cases bargain bin at Fred Meyers.
<ul><li>There were some awesome power tools stores and random stalls at the markets</li></ul>
  (zip tie stall, battery stalls, recycled flourescent light bulb stall, cell
phone stalls every 10 feet)
<ul><li>People love Samsung and Apple. I see Samsung smart phones everywhere.</li><li>It's pretty hot but people are wearing pants and hoodies anyway. I'd hate to</li></ul>
  see this place in the summer</p><p></p></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'olegdbblog';(function() {var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true;dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js';(document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);})();</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href="http://disqus.com" class="dsq-brlink">comments powered by <span class="logo-disqus">Disqus</span></a></div></div></div>
