  Turns out they don't actually serve just coffee, so I had an espresso. This
  was somehow black.
<ul><li>Decided to go to the only eatery in Chai Wan that our guide book mentioned,</li></ul>
  Chaiwanese. We made the trek out along Chai Wan road and made our way up to
the 13th floor of the buildoing it was in. They were closed for renovations,
which is too bad because it looked like an awesome place. We took the stairs all
the way down the 14 floors, which was kind of interesting.
<ul><li>Walked back to the apartment to decide where to go for brunch. Picked a place</li></ul>
  called the Capital Cafe. Had breakfasty food. Again, no black coffee. I had
some kind of Macaroni and Ham breakfast meal.
<ul><li>On the way back to the MTR station we stopped into a little stationary/book</li></ul>
  shop. I didn't see anything that quite struck me so I left. Claire bought some
pencils.
<ul><li>Went to the Wan Chai computer center again and bought two Ducky Shine 3</li></ul>
  mechanical keyboards. They're a little diffult to find stateside so I'm going
to try to sell them,
<ul><li>Took the MTR to Causeway Bay which we hadn't yet explored with the goal of</li></ul>
  finding Vmeet Ltd and G.O.D.
<ul><li>Wandered around for an hour or so. Got lost. Didn't find either place,</li></ul>
  apparently they're closed or non-existent or something.
<ul><li>At this point we were sick of the mall crowd (Times Square is a huge mall and</li></ul>
  the crowds were thick) so we decided to go back to the hotel to rest for a
bit.
<ul><li>Stopped at 7-11 on the way back to get something, all of the things in the</li></ul>
  7-11 are awesome. I bought what I thought was black coffee. It was not. Life
is suffering.
<ul><li>Theres a little Dim Sum place next to the 7-11 so we picked up some buns.</li></ul>
  Didn't get them toasted which was a mistake, they were pretty good anyway
though.
<ul><li>Ate the buns at the top of our building, which was pretty cool. Very good view</li></ul>
  of the graves on the hill.
<ul><li>Back in the apartment.</li></ul></p><p>The plan now is to head back out to Sham Shui Po around 3:30, I want to see if I
can find a Xiaomi Mi3 out there that isn't fake or egregiously priced. I might
pick one up. Claire also wants to stop at the little toy shops again and maybe
pick up more trinkets.</p><p>Turns out there was a close-by tech store that claimed to have Xiaomi Mi3s in
stock. I hiked out to the 15th floor of an industrial tower and knocked on the
door. The guy talked me out of it by explaining (I think) that the mainland
chinese version of the phone probably wouldn't do what I want. I took the stairs
down.</p><p>Spent the rest of the after noon in the hotel room, neither Claire nor myself
really wanted to go anywhere. We just lazed around.</p><p>For dinner I ended up wandering around and found my way into another shopping
mall, not the one that we usually pass through to get to our hostel. I ate at a
McDonalds, because it seems to actually be legitimate here. The food
surprisingly didn't look terrible. Still tasted like McDonald's and left me
feeling pretty greasy.</p><p>I now have an enormous amount of respect for the expats that come to live here,
and in other asian societies without knowing the language. Wandering around in a
huge throng of people is very sombering. It makes you feel very alone and very
insignificant.</p><p>Observations:</p><p><ul><li>You cannot get black coffee anywhere. It is automatically full of milk by</li></ul>
  default. I had luck at Starbucks after some bickering, but that was it.
<ul><li>There are very few people with backpacks. Seems everyone pretty much lives out</li></ul>
  of their pockets and their phones, which makes sense seeing as everything is
so close together.
<ul><li>Watch shops. Watch shops everywhere. Rolex, Omega, alternate and repeat</li></ul>
  forever.
<ul><li>The sheer amount of human capital that is employed to keep the streets clean</li></ul>
  is astonishing. They do a really good job, making the smog the only thing that
dirties the streets.</p><p></p></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'olegdbblog';(function() {var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true;dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js';(document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);})();</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href="http://disqus.com" class="dsq-brlink">comments powered by <span class="logo-disqus">Disqus</span></a></div></div></div>
