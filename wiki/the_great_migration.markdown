title: The Great Migrations
---

Alright, it's time, [shithouse.tv](https://shithouse.tv/) and associated
services are on an old 16.04 Ubuntu box. It's time to move. This is a list of services
that need to be moved over, and their status.

## Services 

* [WheyPI](https://wheypi.shithouse.tv/)
    * Should be updated to be systemd or something.
    * Also grab Postgres DB.
* [shithouse.tv](https://shithouse.tv/)
* [shithouse.tv static sites](https://shithouse.tv/)
* [OlegDB](https://olegdb.org/)
* [q.pfiffer.org](https://q.pfiffer.org/)
* [infoforcefeed.shithouse.tv](https://infoforcefeed.shithouse.tv//)
    * This should probably also be updated to not use Kyoto Cabinet.
* PDXBurritoReview

## Misc.

* SSL for everything
* Weechat client
* Mosh
* Postgres for anything above
* PDXB
