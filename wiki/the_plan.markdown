title: THE PLAN
---

You fucking idiot. I said don't get complacent and now here you are.

# Runs
* Wildwood end-to-end
* St. Helens
* Dog Mountain laps

# Tangibles
1. Get a data plan. Get mobile.
1. Pay off all your debt. Taxes, medical, credit card, next year's taxes.
1. Get a new car. Something with utility that you can sleep in.
1. Buy the gear you actually need, stop just scraping by with what you think you
   can deal with
1. Track, obviously.
1. I want to do adventures. I want to go places. I want to see things, despite
   how I feel day-to-day this is real. Even if I don't think I want to go, I do.
   I will appreciate these things.
1. Packraft more places. Get more comfortable and better. Maybe try a hardshell
   sometime.
1. Do you really want to be doing web dev for the rest of your life? Can you?
   Are you just going to burn yourself out again?


# Intangibles
1. Stay challenged. Challenge yourself. Find a mentor or something. When was
   the last time you learned something?
1. Get excited. Don't get complacent. Stay away from social media.
1. Read.
1. The nihilism isn't funny anymore. Be supportive. Be verbal. Be helpful. Do good.
   Make other people laugh. Say the things you're thinking.

I've had a lot of feelings lately, good and bad, and I wanted to write this. I
needed a good kick in the teeth, and I definitely got it. Sure, the broken arm
sucks, but all that did was show a lot of underlying issues that have been
simmering for a while.

You're right in that we do have different backgrounds, and we're drawn to
different people. I feel that, but theres a reason I like doing things with you
and being challenged by you. We share a common desire to *do*, to
experience more no matter what, to see things and feel them. The last
thing I want is to be stuck, cold and unfeeling and uncaring. Distracted and
muddling around in the same puddle for the rest of my life.

I *do* dream, I do think about the future, about what I want and how to achieve
it. I've already done things I would never have thought about before I met you.

Im sorry I didn't say anything on your birthday, that I was in such an empty
mood christmas morning. I regret not texting you when your race was over. I
regret not answering your phone call the night before Bend. I regret not being
present in all those times I wasn't, or that I scoff at your ideas when you're
obviously excited about them.  I'm sorry that I never seem to make any progress,
that I shrug you off when I obviously need something but can't be bothered to care 
about it. I'm sorry I told you I felt like I should be able to
walk away from anything in my life at a moment's notice.

I'm sorry I'm not always excited even when I have every right to be,
that I'm not the person you want to bounce ideas off of and
spitball and dream with.

I like your energy. It reminds me that not everything is dark and do-or-die and
Dr. Doom. It's important for me to see that, and to believe in it. I miss
talking with you.

That's all.
