### Food

#### Fuel During

* Cheese and Bread: Good thick cut bread, with a solid cheese. Cheddar is fine
  but preferably something bulkier.
* PB&J
* Baked Sweet Potatoes
* Dried mango
* Banana + honey/PB sandwhich

> I grabbed peanut butter, jelly, and a seedy wheat bread—and some thin-sliced mozzarella, because why not. The resultant sandwich, while admittedly strange, packed in more than 30 grams of protein—the magic number for refueling working muscle, according to a 2009 study published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association—and nearly 700 calories.

### Recipes/Ratios

* Red Lentils + White Rice - 3:1 for lentils, 2:1 for rice. My goto is a
  half-cup of each, so 2.5 cups of water to the whole mix. I find it comes out
  less mushy if you do something like 2.3 cups of water (just eyeball it)
* Steel-cut Oats: 3:1 water:oats ratio. Throw oats in boiling, return to
  boiling, then simmer for 30 minutes. Add some milk (or whatever) after 30 minutes,
  then let it sit a little longer.

### To Try:

* Chicken/Tofu curry, throw into thermos and bring along as lunch.
