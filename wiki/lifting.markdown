title: Lifting Log
---

Ideas for graphs:

* Weekly frequency (Lifts per day per week)
* Session weight moved
* exercize frequency per week
* Weight chart per session per date (Line graph, shows weight moved)
* "Exertion" reps * sets * weight per session
* percentage lift over time, should be percentage of 1RM, or the most lifted up
  to that point.

Format is sets by reps @ weight in pounds.
