## Mod Ideas

* [Rage Racing uses this battery](https://shop.odysseybattery.com/p/pc680)

## Low-priority Parts to get

* Another defroster switch, for the right side, to toggle fog lights.

* Rear window visor

## Misc. Work

    * Possible color code 150? Check driver's side door jam. "A typical code

      example."

## RALLY

* [Some weird fbook profile with a lot of stuff done](https://www.facebook.com/HRmotorsport-284165204968259/?ref=profile)
* [Pahl's](https://www.instagram.com/pahls_racing/)

## Fog Lights

The regular headlights are weak and not very rally car. Adding foglights seems
like a pretty easy mod.

Inspiration:

* [Marchal 750s](https://www.reddit.com/r/mr2/comments/5hj3tt/not_matching_but_back_together/)
* [Hella 550s](https://www.reddit.com/r/mr2/comments/173xkw/hella_bright_one_more_in_comments/)

## Suspension Work
* <input disabled type="checkbox" />Strut Replacement
    * [Front](https://twosrus.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id#135)
    * [Rear](https://twosrus.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id#136)
* <input disabled type="checkbox" />Strut Top Replacements
    * [Front](https://twosrus.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id#563)
    * [Rear](https://twosrus.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id#586)
* Front-right strut mount is loose or something. It's a bit fucked.

## Lights
* <input disabled type="checkbox" />Fix Headlight Skew
* <input disabled type="checkbox" />Fog-lights?

## Update Feb. 11 2017

Car sounds terrible. Power loss. The exhaust sounds different now. I can feel
hitching sometimes as the car is accelerating or maintaining speed with the
accelerator in. I can smell burning upon exiting the car. Something is very wrong.
Muffler/exhaust work might need to be done now for real.

Update: Put in a new muffler, helked a lot. Also replaced the spark plugs.

## Update Nov. 30 2017

Took the car into the shop to get a bunch of stuff done, heft price but overall
good:

* Fix multiple oil leaks (Finally getting valve cover gaskets replaced)
* Inner tie-rode ends are loose and need fixed
* Squeaky front-struts

To ask:
* Good snow/dirt all-season all-terrain tires
* Lift? Coilovers?

# WHITE MR2

* [Confirming Rod Knock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Eyk7cRgYX0)
    * It has rod knock. We tore off the oil pan and the crank journal was fucked.
* Bleed brakelines so we can rotate the rear wheels
