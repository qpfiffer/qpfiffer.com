## Mod Ideas

* [Ignition coils](http://www.sq-engineering.com/tech-articles/coilpack-info-guide)

## Low-priority Parts to get

* New seat belts
* New rubber seals everywhere
* Rear window visor

## Misc. Work

* <input disabled type="checkbox" />Get car waxed and paint touched up
    * Possible color code 150? Check driver's side door jam. "A typical code
      will look like C/TR: 1D4/FH13, and 1D4 would be the color code in this
      example."

    * Turns out if the brake light is staying on that just means the brake fluid
      is low

## Fog Lights

The regular headlights are weak and not very rally car. Adding foglights seems
like a pretty easy mod.

Inspiration:

* [Marchal 750s](https://www.reddit.com/r/mr2/comments/5hj3tt/not_matching_but_back_together/)
* [Hella 550s](https://www.reddit.com/r/mr2/comments/173xkw/hella_bright_one_more_in_comments/)



## Suspension Work
* <input disabled type="checkbox" />Strut Replacement
    * [Front](https://twosrus.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id#135)
    * [Rear](https://twosrus.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id#136)
* <input disabled type="checkbox" />Strut Top Replacements
    * [Front](https://twosrus.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id#563)
    * [Rear](https://twosrus.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id#586)
* Front-right strut mount is loose or something. It's a bit fucked.

* <input disabled type="checkbox" />Fog-lights?

## Update Fed. 11 2017

Car sounds terrible. Power loss. The exhaust sounds different now. I can feel
hitching sometimes as the car is accelerating or maintaining speed with the
accelerator in. I can smell burning upon exiting the car. Something is very wrong.
Muffler/exhaust work might need to be done now for real.

Update: Put in a new muffler, helked a lot. Also replaced the spark plugs.
