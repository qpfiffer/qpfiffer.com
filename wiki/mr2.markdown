## Mod Ideas

* [Ignition coils](http://www.sq-engineering.com/tech-articles/coilpack-info-guide)
* [Rage Racing uses this battery](https://shop.odysseybattery.com/p/pc680)

## Low-priority Parts to get

* Another defroster switch, for the right side, to toggle fog lights.

* <input disabled type="checkbox" checked/>Replace alternator
* <input disabled type="checkbox" />Tighten alternator belt
* <input disabled type="checkbox" />Get car waxed and paint touched up
    * Possible color code 150? Check driver's side door jam. "A typical code
      will look like C/TR: 1D4/FH13, and 1D4 would be the color code in this
      example."

* <input disabled type="checkbox" checked />Replace distributor cap
* <input disabled type="checkbox" checked />Fix Exhaust Rattle

* <input disabled type="checkbox" checked />Fix Windshield Mister
    * I'm just an idiot this has worked the whole time.
* <input disabled type="checkbox" checked/>Fix parking brake
    * Turns out if the brake light is staying on that just means the brake fluid
      is low

## RALLY

* [Some weird fbook profile with a lot of stuff done](https://www.facebook.com/HRmotorsport-284165204968259/?ref=profile)
* [Pahl's](https://www.instagram.com/pahls_racing/)
* [Rage Racing](https://www.instagram.com/rageracing/)

## Fog Lights

The regular headlights are weak and not very rally car. Adding foglights seems
like a pretty easy mod.

Inspiration:

* [Marchal 750s](https://www.reddit.com/r/mr2/comments/5hj3tt/not_matching_but_back_together/)
* [Hella 550s](https://www.reddit.com/r/mr2/comments/173xkw/hella_bright_one_more_in_comments/)

## Suspension Work
* <input disabled type="checkbox" />Strut Replacement
    * [Front](https://twosrus.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id#135)
    * [Rear](https://twosrus.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id#136)
* <input disabled type="checkbox" />Strut Top Replacements
    * [Front](https://twosrus.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id#563)
    * [Rear](https://twosrus.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id#586)
* Front-right strut mount is loose or something. It's a bit fucked.

## Lights
* <input disabled type="checkbox" />Fix Headlight Skew
* <input disabled type="checkbox" />Fog-lights?

## Update Feb. 11 2017

Car sounds terrible. Power loss. The exhaust sounds different now. I can feel
hitching sometimes as the car is accelerating or maintaining speed with the
accelerator in. I can smell burning upon exiting the car. Something is very wrong.
Muffler/exhaust work might need to be done now for real.

Update: Put in a new muffler, helked a lot. Also replaced the spark plugs.

## Update Nov. 30 2017

Took the car into the shop to get a bunch of stuff done, heft price but overall
good:

* Fix multiple oil leaks (Finally getting valve cover gaskets replaced)
* Inner tie-rode ends are loose and need fixed
* Squeaky front-struts

To ask:
* Good snow/dirt all-season all-terrain tires
* Lift? Coilovers?

# WHITE MR2

* [Confirming Rod Knock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Eyk7cRgYX0)
    * It has rod knock. We tore off the oil pan and the crank journal was fucked.
* [X] Bleed brakelines so we can rotate the rear wheels
* [] Move Battery up Front (improves weight distribution, frees up engine bay)
* [] Replace rear brake pads

I bought a white 1985 MR2 for $400. It doesn't run but it's hilarious. This is the cost breakdown, so far.

## Dropping the engine Checklist

[All from D4A](http://www.driving4answers.com/how-to-remove-the-engine-mr2-mk1/) and it's very good.

- X Drain coolant from engine
- X Drain coolant from radiator
- X Disconnect and remove battery 
- X Remove air flow meter
- X Remove coolant overflow tank
- x Remove throttle body
- X Remove throttle bracket
- X Remove brake booster hose
- Remove coolant filler neck
- Disconnect oil cooler lines
- Disconnect all the wire harness connections to the engine. There’s a quite a bit
  of these. Take it easy and it one by one. Don’t yank and don’t be aggressive.
  Gently bend harness away from engine once you disconnect everything.
- Fuel delivery pipes and fuel rail. (You need to crank the car without it
  turning over several times to relieve the fuel pressure before doing this. Do
  this by removing the ECU fuse. Google it, its easy)
- EGR piping and EGR vacuum modulator and valve
- Vacuum lines/ hoses
- Remove the Intake manifold (the T-VIS thing)
- Exhaust piping, muffler, cat (if you have one), etc
- Remove v-belt and alternator
- Exhaust manifold
- Remove clutch hose
- Disconnect all coolant hoses from thermostat housing and cylinder head
- Disconnect fuel lines
- Disconnect shift (transmission) cables
- Remove drive shafts
- If I missed something you will notice it. I repeat: Big Green Book. Do not start removing
  the engine untl you are 100% sure there is nothing in its way.
- Unbolt engine mounts
- Hoist engine so the chain hoist holds up all the weight
- Drop engine

## Light Mods

A light delete on the #NewR2 might save a lot of weight, and leave me with a
good component to sell on ebay.
