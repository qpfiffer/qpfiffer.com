* Software development for Arsonists:
    * It's a feeling.
    * Sleep on the floor
    * Move your body
    * Manage your memory
    * No dependencies
    * Go read Cmpwn, cat-v, Suckless, DJB
    * Use a static site generator
    * Read gwern and lesswrong stuff
    * Drink your coffee black, flavor isn't punk
    * You're either sitting on the floor or standing at your desk. There is no in between.
    * Sleep on the floor: It's better for your back. If you can sleep on the floor, you can sleep anywhere.
    * Get excited. Write the thing that excites you. Watch and read things from people you admire that are doing cool things.
    * Get a dumb phone.
    * Write, on paper, with a pen. Pencils graphite fades over time. What you write is permanent.
    * Read, paper. Or an e-book. Books that excite you, books that teach you things.
    * Do things that are scary. Do things that are hard. Challenge yourself.
    * Find someone else that challenges you.
    * Listen to really aggresive/noisy/grating music sometimes. Then listen to ambient music. Genre-hop.
    * Don't define your identity based on one thing.
    * Don't get enough sleep sometimes.
    * Find your edge, even if it's jagged.
    * Do things because you want to do them, not because you want other people to see you doing them.
    * Learn how to cook for yourself. Simple, inexpensive meals.
