Similar to the outback attempt last year, but this is longer and way worse. At
least it won't be really hot.

## When

May 2nd - 7th, 2019

We bike to Astoria, stay the night and then start the actual
[race](https://www.facebook.com/Oregon-Emerald-Outback-237299430247671/) at
6:30AM the next day. 600 miles. 150 miles a day, for four days. BRUTAL.

Bike to Medford, take the train home. Easy!
