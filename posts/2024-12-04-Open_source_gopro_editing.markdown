This is a draft for now, but the important bits:

# Shooting
* Always shoot 10-bit footage
* Shoot with -0.5 EV comp at least, unless it's fantastically sunny
* Low light footage should be shot with ISO 100/400
* Use natural, flat or LOG color encoding.
* 60 FPS is good for motion.


# Editing
* Use Kdenlive
* Set resolution to 3840x2160
* 30 FPS at the very least, 24 FPS if you have an ND filter and want some cool
  blur
* Video bitrate of at least 20 mb/s, 24 is better, 30 even better than that
* Variable bitrate probably isn't a bad idea
