I'm in Eagle, ID now for the next five-ish weeks. This is a list of stuff that I
want to do or accomplis or see or whatever. This is a living document.

## Misc.

* Buy a hardshell
    * Theres whitewater kayaks for sale all over the place, get one.
* Learn to roll a kayak

## Rivers

Paddle as MUCH AS POSSIBLE. Idaho is a whitewater mecca.

* Payette
    * Main Run (Banks to Beehive)
    * Swirly Canyon (Duh)
    * Staircase (Ambitious)
    * The Canyon Run (Ambitious)
    * Grandjean to Deadwood (probably just to Kirkham hot springs)
* Deadwood
    * I've wanted to do this one for a long time- hike in, paddle out. Perfect
      for packrafters and the water is ultra low.
* Snake River
* Grand Ronde

## Climbing

* City of Rocks

## MTB

## Running
