This year, for our two-ish weeks of vacation, Megan wanted very badly to do the
[Nahanni adventure](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105905652/lotus-flower-tower). Again. And it didn't happen- again. This is the third time
she's been unable to make it work, due to unforseen circumstances or whatever.
This year it was, like last year, COVID stuff. Canada was inaccessible.

So instead, we decided to go to Krygyzstan- this was for a lot of reasons but
the two big ones were [this film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhFx17s4a2E) by Kyle Dempster and the [Silk Road Mountain
Race](https://www.silkroadmountainrace.cc/). Being unable to find a reason _not_
to go, and a million reasons we should, we pulled the trigger on some plane
tickets.

We hemmed and hawed for a while about doing the actual race, but decided it
wasn't quite the experience we were looking for, so we opted to do the infamous
[Tian Shan Traverse](https://bikepacking.com/routes/tian-shan-traverse-kyrgyzstan/) instead. We didn't have 20 days to spare so 12 would have
to do. This turned out to be just about our limit for the terrain, which I'll
get into later.

# Training, Logistics and Testing

## Logistics

We had about six weeks to figure everything out and get into shape for the ride.
That means making sure the bikes were good, we had the right gear, creating bike
boxes to transport them across the ocean, etc. We also had to figure out where
we were going to leave all of our stuff- we're nomadic and move locations every
six weeks or so. Stashing our cars and all of our earthly posessions while we were
away was non-trivial. There was a lot to do. Somehow we
postponed most of the major bits until a week or two before. I had parts coming
in the day before we were supposed to leave on the plane.

Luckily Megan is great at talking to people and managed to smooth out all sorts
of logistics issues- A friend of a friend ours offered to stash our stuff, we
hooked up with some Lithuanians via the comments section on bikepacking.com to
handle transpotation to the start of the ride and Megan managed to find
accomodation for us in all of the necessary places (like Dubai on the way back,
super fun 24-hour layerover). I mostly did bike fiddling and mechanical stuff.

## Training

We didn't train especially hard for this, but we probably should I have done
more. I did some hill repeats and tried to focus on strength for the inevitable
hike-a-bike with heavy bikes, and Megan put a lot of time in on the bike.
Something that I felt helped a lot but was kind of unintended was all of the
push-ups, lots of the hike-a-bike was upper body heavy and I felt well-prepared.

## Testing

We didn't do a whole lot of gear testing since our setups our mostly dialed, but
we did change quite a few things. Megan picked up a quilt and a new inflatable
sleeping pad. I got a different
[sleeping pad](https://rockgeist.com/product/animalist-sleeping-pad/). I picked
up different bars and grips. Megan got two new amazing bags from [Alpine
Luddites](https://alpine-luddites.myshopify.com/). In hindsight this was
probably all a lot to change right before a long trip without adequate testing.
Much of my kit was just based on my [Emerald packing
list](https://q.pfiffer.org/posts/2019-05-12-Emerald_Outback_2019.html), but the things
that changed weren't insignificant. 

I decided to use the only bike I have, a [Surly Wednesday](https://surlybikes.com/bikes/wednesday) and Megan went with
her bikepacking rig, a Salsa Woodsmoke (27.5).

# Day 0

After a 15-hour flight to Dubai, and then a 4-hour flight to Bishkek we arrived
at 4AM local time. The previously-mentioned Lithuanians we were collaborating
with had pointed out [Iron Horse Nomads](https://ironhorsenomads.com/) to us as our sort of local goto, and
they arranged for someone to pick us up at the airport. It's always novel to see
yours (actually Megan's) name on a piece of paper among a dozen others.

A short shuttle ride into a new city, picked up fuel and other things we forgot
(like the multitool, oops) and assembled bikes. It's always fun to pack all your
food and such into the bikes, to see how heavy they are. We left later that
afternoon for the long shuttle ride to our starting point, Kysyl-su on the
southeast side of lake Issyk-kul.

The jetlag hit me pretty hard on the way there and I mostly
snoozed the whole ride despite the valiant attempts by our new Lithuanian
friends to make conversation. We got in around dusk and found the one hotel
, where we met some latvians who were also there to do the route. They seemed
impressed at our desire to do the whole thing in ~11 days instead of the
allocated 20.

Something crazy happened, in that someone actually _stole_ Megan's phone our of
the car. She couldn't find it, and just then some old guy walked in off the
street waving her phone around saying (in Kyrgyz) "Is this anyone's phone?"- we
pulled up the CCTV footage and some rando had walked in and taken it right out
of the car while we were all standing there distracted, then this other guy got
it back somehow. It was a weird start to the night. We were a little more
guarded after that.

We passed out after showers and stashing our bikes and a late, simple dinner of
rice and eggs. The room + the meal were something like $15.00 USD, I think.

# Day 1

<img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_1_1.jpg"></img>

We got up early, setup our bikes and got everything ready to go at 6AM. No
breakfast, just some donut holes that Megan had managed to transport mostly
un-mangled from the US. One of our Lithuanian friends took some pictures of us
as we started off into the chilly morning.

It didn't take long before we were out of town and climbing up the valley
towards Dhzuku pass. Progress was slow, but our bikes were heavy with water and
food. It was immediately unreal and magical out there. Lots of yurts, horses,
cows, etc. everywhere. Cars passed us occasionally.

We tromped through a few streams, and eventually the trail got steeper and
narrower, hemming us into the little valley. The trees eventually disappeared
and a few lakes made their appearance. A man with golden teeth driving a
Mitsubishi Delica flew by us and camped somewhere up the road before it became
more or less impassable.

After a few hours of soul-crushing hike-a-bike at `11,200ft` we decided to call
it a day. We were tired of splattering the bikes with cowshit and picked a nice
spot next to a stream before the final hellish push up the pass. We'd done 37
miles and about 6k feet of climbing- under our goal of 50-a-day but we knew the
first day would be tough. 

The jetlag and our lack of acclimatization was also showing, 11k felt
very rough. Megan fell asleep at 6:30PM and I not long after.

Oh, and we said "Yarrr!" all day- or at least I did.

# Day 2

<img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_2_1.jpg"></img>

We managed to make it up at 6AM despite a rough night of sleep- our new Ultamid
is missing a tie-down meaning one side flapped in the wind all night repeatedly
slapping Megan. Not great. We were puffy and still kind of tired when we forced
ourselves to get out of the tent. We sheltered behind some rocks to get out of
the cold while we ate breakfast and packed up.

It was immediately hike-a-bike straight up and took a while. Dhzuku pass is
pretty high up, something like 12k feet and it took a while to push our bikes up
the loose, babyhead-sized gravel path to the top. We stopped a lot to catch our
breath.

Eventually, we made it to the top and could start riding. Sort of. It was slow
going up at the top, something the map called "Alpine Cold Desert", which I felt
was apt- just grass everywhere, game trails, and mud. It was marshy, and felt
like we were in a big bowl surrouned by glaciers and peaks. Very pretty.

After getting lost a little, a few stream crossings, riding on grass and dry mud
and every other surface you can imagine, we made it to an actual road and moved
quickly for a while. As quick as you can with fully loaded bikes at 12,000 feet,
anyway.

After more arduous, slow riding up dirt roads we came to Arabel pass, which was
just breakth-taking. It felt good to get away from the altitude headaches, and
even better to move really fast. The downhill eventually gave way to flat, and
some rain, and I forced us to keep going for a while despite the thunder and
sideways rain.

We pitched camp after the rain ended in a small, semi-sheltered ravine near some interesting rock
conglomerations.
