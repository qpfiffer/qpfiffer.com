This year, for our two-ish weeks of vacation, Megan wanted very badly to do the
[Nahanni adventure](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105905652/lotus-flower-tower). Again. And it didn't happen- again. This is the third time
she's been unable to make it work, due to unforseen circumstances or whatever.
This year it was, like last year, COVID stuff. Canada was inaccessible.

So instead, we decided to go to Krygyzstan- this was for a lot of reasons but
the two big ones were [this film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhFx17s4a2E) by Kyle Dempster and the [Silk Road Mountain
Race](https://www.silkroadmountainrace.cc/). Being unable to find a reason _not_
to go, and a million reasons we should, we pulled the trigger on some plane
tickets.

We hemmed and hawed for a while about doing the actual race, but decided it
wasn't quite the experience we were looking for, so we opted to do the infamous
[Tian Shan Traverse](https://bikepacking.com/routes/tian-shan-traverse-kyrgyzstan/) instead. We didn't have 20 days to spare so 12 would have
to do. This turned out to be just about our limit for the terrain, which I'll
get into later.

# Day 0 (and before)

We had about six weeks to figure everything out and get into shape for the ride.
That means making sure the bikes were good, we had the right gear, creating bike
boxes to transport them across the ocean, etc. There was a lot to do. Somehow we
postponed most of the major bits until a week or two before. I had parts coming
in the day before we were supposed to leave on the plane.

We've got two weeks off this August and the planning has dwindled down to one
thing: Kyrgyzstan bikepacking. This is my personal planning document.
