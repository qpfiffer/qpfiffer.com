This year, for our two-ish weeks of vacation, Megan wanted very badly to do the
[Nahanni adventure](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105905652/lotus-flower-tower). Again. And it didn't happen- again. This is the third time
she's been unable to make it work, due to unforseen circumstances or whatever.
This year it was, like last year, COVID stuff. Canada was inaccessible.

So instead, we decided to go to Krygyzstan- this was for a lot of reasons but
the two big ones were [this film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhFx17s4a2E) by Kyle Dempster and the [Silk Road Mountain
Race](https://www.silkroadmountainrace.cc/). Being unable to find a reason _not_
to go, and a million reasons we should, we pulled the trigger on some plane
tickets.

We hemmed and hawed for a while about doing the actual race, but decided it
wasn't quite the experience we were looking for, so we opted to do the infamous
[Tian Shan Traverse](https://bikepacking.com/routes/tian-shan-traverse-kyrgyzstan/) instead. We didn't have 20 days to spare so 12 would have
to do. This turned out to be just about our limit for the terrain, which I'll
get into later.

# Training, Logistics and Testing

## Logistics

We had about six weeks to figure everything out and get into shape for the ride.
That means making sure the bikes were good, we had the right gear, creating bike
boxes to transport them across the ocean, etc. We also had to figure out where
we were going to leave all of our stuff- we're nomadic and move locations every
six weeks or so. Stashing our cars and all of our earthly posessions while we were
away was non-trivial. There was a lot to do. Somehow we
postponed most of the major bits until a week or two before. I had parts coming
in the day before we were supposed to leave on the plane.

Luckily Megan is great at talking to people and managed to smooth out all sorts
of logistics issues- A friend of a friend ours offered to stash our stuff, we
hooked up with some Lithuanians via the comments section on bikepacking.com to
handle transpotation to the start of the ride and Megan managed to find
accomodation for us in all of the necessary places (like Dubai on the way back,
super fun 24-hour layeover). I mostly did bike fiddling and mechanical stuff.

## Training

We didn't train especially hard for this, but we probably should have done
more. I did some hill repeats and tried to focus on strength for the inevitable
hike-a-bike with heavy bikes, and Megan put a lot of pedal time in.
Something that I felt helped a lot but was kind of unintended was all of the
push-ups, lots of the hiking was upper body heavy and I felt well-prepared.

## Testing

We didn't do a whole lot of gear testing either since our setups are mostly dialed, but
we did change quite a few things. Megan picked up a quilt and a new inflatable
sleeping pad. I got a different
[sleeping pad](https://rockgeist.com/product/animalist-sleeping-pad/), and different bars + grips. 
Megan got two new amazing bags from [Alpine
Luddites](https://alpine-luddites.myshopify.com/). In hindsight this was
probably all a lot to change right before a long trip without adequate testing.
Much of my kit was just based on my [Emerald packing
list](https://q.pfiffer.org/posts/2019-05-12-Emerald_Outback_2019.html), but the things
that changed weren't insignificant. 

I decided to use the only bike I have, a [Surly Wednesday](https://surlybikes.com/bikes/wednesday) and Megan went with
her bikepacking rig, a Salsa Woodsmoke (27.5).

# Day 0

After a 15-hour flight to Dubai, and then a 4-hour flight to Bishkek we arrived
at 4AM local time. The previously-mentioned Lithuanians we were collaborating
with had pointed out [Iron Horse Nomads](https://ironhorsenomads.com/) to us as our sort of local goto, and
they arranged for someone to pick us up at the airport. It's always novel to see
yours (actually Megan's) name on a piece of paper among a dozen others held by
some random person waiting to pick you up.

After a short shuttle ride into a new city, we picked up fuel and other things we forgot
(like the multitool, oops) and assembled bikes. Packing all your
food and such into the bikes and seeing how heavy they are is always a no-return
moment. We left later that
afternoon for the long shuttle ride to our starting point, Kysyl-su on the
southeast side of lake Issyk-kul.

The jetlag hit me pretty hard on the way there and I mostly
snoozed the whole ride despite the valiant attempts by our new
friends to make conversation. We got in around dusk and found the one hotel
where we met some latvians who were also there to do the route. They seemed
impressed at our desire to do the whole thing in ~11 days instead of the
allocated 20.

Something crazy happened, in that someone actually _stole_ Megan's phone out of
the car. She couldn't find it, and just then some old guy walked in off the
street waving her phone around saying (in Kyrgyz) "Is this anyone's phone?"- we
pulled up the CCTV footage and some rando had walked in and taken it right out
of the car while we were all standing there distracted, then this other guy got
it back somehow. It was a weird start to the night. We were a little more
guarded after that.

We passed out after showers and stashing our bikes and a late, simple dinner of
rice and eggs. The room + the meal were something like $15.00 USD, I think.

# Day 1

<img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_1_1.jpg"></img>

We got up early, setup our bikes and had everything ready to go by 6AM. No
breakfast, just some donut holes that Megan had managed to transport mostly
un-mangled from the US. One of our friends took some pictures of us
as we started off into the chilly morning.

It didn't take long before we were out of town and climbing up the valley
towards Dhzuku pass. Progress was slow, but our bikes were heavy with water and
food. It was immediately unreal and magical out there. Lots of yurts, horses,
cows, etc. everywhere. Cars passed us occasionally.

<img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_1_2.jpg"></img>

We tromped through a few streams, and eventually the trail got steeper and
narrower, hemming us into the little valley. The trees eventually disappeared
and a few lakes made their appearance. A man with golden teeth driving a
Mitsubishi Delica flew by us and camped somewhere up the road before it became
more or less impassable.

<img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_1_3.jpg"></img>

After a few hours of soul-crushing hike-a-bike at `11,200ft` we decided to call
it a day. We were tired of splattering the bikes with cowshit and picked a nice
spot next to a stream before the final hellish push up the pass. We'd done 37
miles and about 6k feet of climbing- under our goal of 50-a-day but we knew the
first day would be tough. 

The jetlag and our lack of acclimatization was also showing, 11k felt
very rough. Megan fell asleep at 6:30PM and I not long after.

<img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_1_4.jpg"></img>

Oh, and we said "Yarrr!" all day- or at least I did.

# Day 2

<img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_2_1.jpg"></img>

We managed to make it up at 6AM despite a rough night of sleep- our new Ultamid
is missing a tie-down meaning one side flapped in the wind all night repeatedly
slapping Megan. Not great. We were puffy and still kind of tired when we forced
ourselves to get out of the tent. We sheltered behind some rocks to get out of
the cold while we ate breakfast and packed up.

It was immediately hike-a-bike straight up. Dhzuku pass is
pretty high up, something like 12k feet and it took a while to push our bikes up
the loose, babyhead-sized gravel path to the top. We stopped a lot to catch our
breath.

Eventually, we made it to the top and could start riding. Sort of. It was slow
going along the "flat" section after the pass, something the map called an "Alpine Cold Desert", which I felt
was apt- just grass everywhere, game trails, and mud. It was marshy, and felt
like we were in a big bowl surrouned by glaciers and peaks. Very pretty.

<img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_2_2.jpg"></img>

After getting lost a little, a few stream crossings, riding on grass and dry mud
and every other surface you can imagine, we made it to an actual road and moved
quickly. Well, as quick as you can with fully loaded bikes at 12,000 feet,
anyway.

<img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_2_3.jpg"></img>

After more arduous, slow riding up dirt roads we came to Arabel pass, which was
just breath-taking. It felt good to get away from the altitude headaches, and
even better to move really fast. The downhill eventually gave way to flat, and
some rain, and I forced us to keep going for a while despite the thunder and
sideways droplets.

<img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_2_4.jpg"></img>

We pitched the tent after the rain ended in a small, semi-sheltered ravine near some interesting rock
conglomerations.

# Day 3

<img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_3_1.jpg"></img>

Somehow my shoes dried overnight- I think it was that windy. I think I'd slept
well but I don't remember. It took us a couple hours to eat breakfast and pack,
by which time a boy had come over on a horse and invited us over for tea. He was
only 14, but would be very happy if we'd come by. He watched while we packed up
everything and got ready to go. Along the way we met his horse ("Toro", with a
small star shaved in his side) and saw their captive fish- caught in the river
and placed in a small, dammed stream near the house. Presumably to fatten up and
eat later.

Turns out "tea" meant "breakfast" and by the time we arrived, there was a
whole spread of foodstuffs on the table- lots of dairy, some apricot preserves,
and bread. I couldn't really identify all of the dairy but it was great. We hung
out and tried to chat around the language barrier, which was great fun.

Later, Megan got to milk a cow and they showed us how they rendered the
milk
into various things- cheese, cream, curds, etc. They gave us both some
_Kumis_, fermented horsemilk, and I ended up drinking Megan's portion. It was
fun to start the day buzzed on a weird, musky drink. It definitely made for
light riding.

We said our goodbyes after a couple of hours and threats to _make sure I was
married to Megan_, and we were off.

<img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_3_2.jpg"></img>

From what I remember, we were mostly on chunky double-track until we got closer
to a main-ish road, and I spent a long time looking at the river.
The day went from a semi-overcast to nice and sunny pretty quickly. For some reason
I refused to air down and just rattled myself all the
way to the beautiful river from above. It was mostly pleasant riding for a while
and we saw a couple of adventure-y looking motorcyclists heading up to where we
had just came from.

<img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_3_3.jpg"></img>

Towards the end of the day, as we headed up into a small set of double-passes,
it started to rain (and thunder). I felt okay and kind of egged us on, but Megan
was feeling apprehensive. It was very beautiful where we ended up, but the rain
hit us pretty hard and it was a bit miserable. Everything got wet and we were
both a little frozen. Our bikes ended up covered in mud.

<img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_3_4.jpg"></img>

There was some hike-a-bike, too. The descent was amazing though. Everything kind
of dried out and we were in some on-again/off-again sunshine. We put in a few
more miles on the highway and ended at probably the best campsite of the trip,
right on the river in a beautiful valley.

<img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_3_5.jpg"></img>

# Day 4

Our slowest day to get out of camp, we spent a bunch of time waiting for the sun
and drying out some of our gear. Luckily both happened. It was a really nice morning,
but it took us almost three hours to get up and away.

<img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_4_1.jpg"></img>

We followed rolling hills in the sun along an increasingly closed-in gorge-
definitely some Class IV/V sections in there. It'd be a fun descent I think, if
your skills were up to snuff. I'd like to come back here for sure.

Once we made it out of the valley, it was onto large, expansive grassland and
less fun riding. Mostly just dusty, forever-flat roads where we were repeatedly
blasted by the trucks going by. Not quite as engaging. We made it all the way to
Naryn in the early afternoon where we resupplied and had a real meal. I even had
cell service, though I didn't really want it.

We left later and immediately put on to some pavement up a pretty steep, long climb on
the side of the highway. We were on roads for a little while after this so time
flew by, and then we had the best descent, during golden hour, ever.

<img src="/static/img/kyrgyzstan_2021/day_4_2.jpg"></img>

We rolled forever downhill, on really smooth roads. It was nice after the long
slog earlier. This eventually gave way into us losing the trail and mucking
around until dark, but it was good while it lasted.

We blindly trusted another little campspot on GaiaGPS since it'd found us our
beautiful river one, but this turned out to be nothing- we used it anyway. Right
on the side of the road. Kind of noisy all night but we were so tired we didn't
care. We'd put in 63 miles and it felt good to be above our needed daily average
for once.
