Haven't written in a couple of days, let's see what I've done... Quite a lot. Not a
bit? I'm not sure, Taipei is a nice place, aside from all the heat.

Yesterday I decided to go on a hike, because why not? Turns out that was kind of
a bad idea because I am not covered in quite a few mosquito bites. Lesson
learned, buy some pants next time.

Anyways, I decided to try hiking up [象山 (Elephant Mountain)](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293913-d2019764-Reviews-Elephant_Mountain_aka_Nangang_District_Hiking_Trail-Taipei.html)
which isn't really much of a mountain, but is pretty nice anyway. There are
steps all the way up (a _lot_ of steps) with an [incredible view](https://www.flickr.com/photos/104820964@N07/15091326845/) at the top.
I also managed to snag [one of my favorite pictures thus far](https://www.flickr.com/photos/104820964@N07/15088316371/in/photostream/). I'm pretty
sure that that spider is a [Golden silk orb-weaver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_silk_orb-weaver)
and they're pretty common on this side of the ocean. Thats also Taipei 101 in
the background.

I was dog-tired after the hike (I walked there, and walked up, and walked back)
so I headed straight back and didn't do much else.

Today I figured I'd get the postcards I've been meaning to send out, which was a
[fun little adventure](https://twitter.com/WAallLy/status/506379849401790464).
I managed to communicate to the 7-11 clerk that I wanted stamps, score one for
self-confidence. Kenny was a bit impressed I can speak 中文 at all, and so am I.

Speaking of Kenny, all of the people working at the
[hostel](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/3200960) are awesome. They're all helpful,
they speak english pretty well and encourage my broken Mandarin. I'll definitely
stay with them again whenever I come back to Taiwan.

Besides the stamps thing, I woke up kind of late and didn't do much today. I
wandered around near 台北車站 and found a coffee shop that isn't terrible to
hang out for a bit in. Took some pictures along the way.
