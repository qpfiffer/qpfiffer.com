Things are changing, I need a different vehicle. I have a couple months to do
this and quite a bit of time, now, so I can afford to be a little more
discerning than the excited puppy I usually am.

# Why?

I've got a Subaru Forester currently, and it's great, but I can't sit and work
in it in cold climates. I have to have the back-hatch open to really do
anything. This works great when it's pretty mild outside, and I can get away
with hooking up a tarp and hiding behind it when it's rainy, but having a place
that I can sit up straight and heat would be ideal. I don't want to wear
fingerless gloves or anything like that. I mean, I will if I have to.

I want to ski, ice climb and fat bike this winter, and probably do some frigid
boating, too. Being able to have a good spot to come back to thats more or less
warm sounds like a good idea. I can't have all my stuff frozen all the time.

# Priorities

* 4x4/AWD
* Enough clearance/capability to get around on messed up forest roads, climbing
  trails, mud or snow.
* Rally lighting so I can see wtf I'm doing in a blizzard
* At least 20 MPG
* Small enough to fit in a normal parking space (No extended wheelbase or
  anything like that) and daily drive if I need to
* A place I can sit up straight and work from
* A place to sleep (doesn't need to be much)
* Long enough to fit a kayak and/or a bike inside
* 2" Trailer Hitch ability
* Good roofrack potential

## Nice to haves

* Airbags
* Reliability
* Semi-discrete: No pop-top campers.
* Ability to cook inside
* Enough power to get up steep stuff
* Rotors on all wheels, not just the front
* Ability to mount a pull-up bar.

# Candidates

* Sprinter (lol)
* Dodge promaster
* That hilariously tiny NV minivan from Nissan
* Toyota Sienna (dat momlook)
    * You can get these in AWD and some can be lifted.
* Toyota Previa (smooth alien lozenge)
    * Hard to work on and usually beaten to death.
* An old ambulance
    * Big, slow, conspicuous
* A hotshot buggy or something
    * Hard to find
* Mitsubishi Delica
* Toyota Hiace 4x4
* Some kind of truck with a camper in the bed
* Random american van from the last 20 years
    * GMC Sierra/Astrovan
    * Some quigley-converted 4x4 Econoline.
