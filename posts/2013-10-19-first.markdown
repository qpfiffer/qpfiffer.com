This is the first post. From here I'll probably be writing about tech stuff,
things I've done or want to do, whatever. I really just need something kind of
meaty to test the layout and to make sure everything is set up correctly.

The barrier to entry on this wasn't too bad, Hakyll is pretty nice. I haven't
needed to add any javascript for anything the process looks pretty painless
should I ever need to.
