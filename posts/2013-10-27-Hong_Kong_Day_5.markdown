Woke up feeling dehydrated. Went to find food.

* Went to eat breakfast at a place called Tai Hing (I think). Had some kind of
  ramen and coffee from the breakfast set. Again no black coffee.
* Claire wanted to go to the Zoological and Botanical gardens. Headed out to
  central and killed a few hours looking at birds, monkeys and plants.
* On the way back we ended up in the middle of some kind of Hong Kong motorcycle
  show. Got a bunch of swag and got to see some cool looking bikes.
* We were kind of hungry so we walked to the IFC mall, looking for something
  that wasn't completely swamped. For some reason there were hordes of Fillipino
women eeeeeverywhere.
* Most restaurants were occupied so we went to a little high-class cafe called
  Fuel. I had an espresso and some kind of brownie-cake thing. Pretty expensive
there, my stuff cost $10.00 or so USD.
* Headed out to Mong Kok to hit up the arcade again. Burned through maybe $50.0
  HKD. Good times.
* Went back to the hotel to drop of our stuff, and I showed Claire the place I'd
  eaten for breakfast. Day over.

So tomorrow is the day we had back. It's going to be pretty intense.

1. Wake up around 8 or 9 pm. Get breakfast somewhere.
1. Check out before noon.
1. Kill 5 or so hours until we should probably head to the airport to make sure
   we can get through customs/immigration alright.
1. Wait until our flight at 7:20 PM.
1. Fly for 10 hours. Not so bad!
1. Get to Vancouver at approximately 3:40 PM. Leave at 6:300 PM. Get to Portland
   at 7:16 PM. 4 minutes earlier than when we left Hong Kong!
1. Get a ride home.
1. Fall asleep for 12 hours.

Observations:

* Ordering and paying for food is a little different here than in America. Since
  theres no tipping, theres usually a 10% service fee. You usually have to get
someone's attention. Service is usually pretty quick.
* Food is pretty damn cheap, breakfast was something like $3.50USD.
* My nose is always plugged up here. Air quality?
* EVERYTHING is sweetened. The cultural war on bitterness continues.
* There is very little graffiti. It's actually pretty damn clean in this regard.
  Even Sham Shui Po isn't that bad.
