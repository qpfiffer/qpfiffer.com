In August of 2023, for our annual vacation-adventure thing we decided to go to
Tajikistan. Initially we'd planned to head to Baffin Island, but trying to get
there from the Faroe Islands was non-trivial and we didn't really know how to
deal with polar bears. We also really liked Kyrgyzstan last time we were there,
so we were very excited to go.

# Plan

We didn't really have any idea what we'd be doing in the country until a few
weeks ahead of time- I'd had a bunch of rivers I wanted to do, we only really
had packrafts and that was about it. Somehow, eventually, we were tipped off to
the [Murghab River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murghob). Megan was a little
iffy about paddling anything Class IVish, and this looked relatively doable, so
we decided to try it.

A few russian teams have descended the river ([here is a good trip
report](https://www.ski.ru/az/blogs/post/murgab-bartang-1990/)) but otherwise
it's kind of unknown. A [team of
kayakers](https://pamirs.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/its-all-about-kok-jar/) had
also descended it, which gave us some good english beta. For the most part, we
didn't really know what we'd be in for: Probably lots of terrible lake miles,
some way-too-big-class-V+ that we'd have to portage, high altitudes, and a lot of
beautiful scenery. Perfect.

We eventually settled on a plan to paddle the river, cross Lake Sarez to the
Irkht Valley and hike out to the town of Bachor. What could go wrong?

# A New Lake?

I was doing some route-scoping on SentinelHub and stumbled upon a new lake
recently formed on our route, right where all of the really difficult whitewater
was supposed to be. Apparently an [earthquake](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-reports-magnitude-73-earthquake-near-border-with-tajikistan-2023-02-23/) 
in February 2023 had triggered a landslide along the river, blocking it and
damming it, not unlike Lake Sarez itself. I was able to watch via the sattelite
imaggery as the lake slowly filled, then partially released as it broke through
the top of the rubble.

This added a new complication: Parties before us had some rather exciting and
difficult portages along this section, and we had no idea how the landslide
would look once we got there. Would we be able to get over it? Would the
currents force us to stay far away? Could we come up with a plan B?

We decided to go for it anyway, with a rather awful escape plan to get up and
out of the lake if we couldn't scale the landslide. I was optimistic, Megan less
so. We made a large note of this in our trip plan document as a possible snag.

# Day 0

I'll skip a lot of the standard "We lived in a Land Cruiser for a week driving
to Murghab along the Pamir Highway" stuff since this is more of a trip report
and just get right to the day before in Murghob. We, our food, all of our gear
and our optimism made it in-tact to 12,000 feet in the town of Murghob.
