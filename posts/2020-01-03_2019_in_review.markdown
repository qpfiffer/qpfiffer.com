"Always between life and death" - Zybin

Accomplishments
===============

Where do I even start? I'm tired just thinking about it.

### General

* Started logging all/most of my transactions. I started out using an app on
  our trip, which carried over to home life, which eventually has led to
[YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) which I'm still getting used to.
* Got two jobs.
* Didn't have enough money to pay taxes when we got back from Asia so I had to
  go on an installment plan. That sucked. You owe WAY more when thats over.

### Racing/Bikes

* [Repainted my track bike](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzJGB3iFQAy/) in Dazzle camo.

### Adventure

* Ran my own solo [50k around Mt. St.  Helens](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzCUF11F3XA/)
* Ran two ultramarathons, one was [The RUT](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2EnNUalevW/) and the other was [Lastest not Fastest](https://gobeyondracing.com/races/lastest-not-fastest/). It was a monster year of foot racing, for some reason.
* Did my first orienteering race (super fun, definitely want to do more)

### Climbing

### Strength/Fitness

* SO MUCH RUNNNING! I broke my arm and that was pretty much it. Tempo runs,
  uphill workouts, mountain objectives, Mt. Defiance, Helens, Big Sky, all sorts
  of stuff. The worst run of the year was definitely this [Stack Rock run](https://www.strava.com/activities/2552815575) in the heat. I thought I was gonna pass out.
