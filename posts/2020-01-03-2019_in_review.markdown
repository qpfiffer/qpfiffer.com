"Always between life and death" - Zybin

Accomplishments
===============

Where do I even start? I'm tired just thinking about it.

### General

* One big thing I've started doing is that on every trip we go on now, I started
  a "Lessson for X 20YY", and just write down everything I learned, experienced
  or want to look up. I end up with great quotes, bookes to read, lessons that
  are invaluable, etc. They all go in one place and they're really easy to look
  back on.
* My guitar playing is getting there. It's such a fun, productive activity. A
  little bit every day with no plan is more than enough to really make me feel
  like I'm investing in it.
* Started logging all/most of my transactions. I started out using an app on
  our trip, which carried over to home life, which eventually has led to
[YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) which I'm still getting used to.
* Got two jobs.
* Didn't have enough money to pay taxes when we got back from Asia so I had to
  go on an installment plan. That sucked. You owe WAY more when thats over.
* I sewed a bit- a couple bike bags, mostly.
* Learned a lot about communication and what works well for me and having
  emotionally heavy conversations.
* My [car was stolen.](https://www.instagram.com/p/B3NWF0-Fmpl/)
* We did the [Gambler 500](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzVysz0lN8L/) again.
* Visited Grandma!
* Went to Kentucky for like, a day.

### Racing/Bikes

* [Repainted my track bike](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzJGB3iFQAy/) in Dazzle camo.
* Had a [TERRIBL(y great) TIME](http://q.pfiffer.org/posts/2019-05-12-Emerald_Outback_2019) at the Oregon Emerald Outback. The mental
  toughness that I acquired coming out of that trip was amazing. I didn't care
  about physical pain, or cold, or being hungry, or too hot or sweaty or
  dehydrated- it was all fine.
* Did [white rim in a day.](https://www.strava.com/activities/2272744480)
* Had my [biggest single push](https://www.strava.com/activities/2353171792)
  ever, at 160 miles.
* [Red Bull Bay Climb!](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2P6CqOl5_L/) I qualified
  but that was it. Neat event.
* Did my first Alpenrose Velodrome Challenge but it was a pretty bad turnout and
  I hadn't raced all season due to the fucked up arm. Kinda sad.

### Adventure

* Ran my own solo [50k around Mt. St.  Helens](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzCUF11F3XA/)
* Ran two ultramarathons, one was [The RUT](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2EnNUalevW/) and the other was [Lastest not Fastest](https://gobeyondracing.com/races/lastest-not-fastest/). It was a monster year of foot racing, for some reason.
* Did my first orienteering race (super fun, definitely want to do more)
* Two new sports: Skiing and Ice Climbing. I'm pretty stoked on ice climbing I
  think.
* My [packing lists](http://q.pfiffer.org/posts/2019-08-29-Camping_plus_others_megamix) are getting really dialed in.
* The summer was kind of a wash because I broke my arm.
* Got PADI certified and went on 10 dives, 8 in Vali and 2 in the Phillipines.
* Did a solo [bikerafting](https://www.instagram.com/p/BvpKEygFpYS/) adventure. That was hilariously bad, but amazing.
* First ski tour, first ice climb, first hut-to-hut multi-day ski tour: Winter
  sports abound.

### Climbing

* Climbed sport in Tonsai (Thailand), Laos, Cat Ba (Vietnam), Hong Kong and the Phillipines.
* Redpointed my hardest climb ever in the Phillipines.
* Learned how to [crack climb in Indian Creek](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwTbfe9FsPa/), and in Moab (Wall Street)
* Climbed Mt. Hood
* Climbed in the Gunks and the Adirondacks
* Climbed in Red Rocks (Vegas)

### Packrafting

* Survived [Westwater Canyon]() with just Megan - we probably shouldn't have done
  this. Way too dangerous with just the two of us.
* Did part of [Hood River](https://www.strava.com/activities/2235734434) without
  swimming. Would have been COLD.
* Had some scary swims at the [American Packrafting Roundup](https://packraft.org/work/packraft-roundup/) where I [broke a
  paddle.](https://www.instagram.com/p/B0Pj9xqFhw7/)

### Strength/Fitness

* SO MUCH RUNNNING! I broke my arm and that was pretty much it. Tempo runs,
  uphill workouts, mountain objectives, Mt. Defiance, Helens, Big Sky, all sorts
  of stuff. The worst run of the year was definitely this [Stack Rock run](https://www.strava.com/activities/2552815575) in the heat. I thought I was gonna pass out.
* Definitely climbing better than I ever have, pre- and post-break. I'm leading
  in the gym and led quite a bit outside in the beginning of the year. Still now
  trad or ice yet.
* There were a ton of big days, so I'm definitely an endurance athlete now. My
  bodyweight is hovering around 150lbs. I'm not afraid of 12-14 hour pushes yet,
  still haven't broken the 24 hour barrier but I imagine that'll be soon.

### Books

I think Gideon the Ninth was my book of the year- I couldn't put it down. Harry
August was a close second. Also finally read Patrick Rothfuss and couldn't put
any of his books down either. Not as great a turn-out as last year.

* [Exhalations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation:_Stories)
* [The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Fifteen_Lives_of_Harry_August)
* [Gideon the Ninth](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/42036538-gideon-the-ninth)
* [Kiss or Kill](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001C4QYGC/) - Mark Twight

### Code

Not a whole lot to speak of: A couple Oleg commits, some waifu stuff,
pdxburritoreview, my own resume, just random things. Some Voidcrash work that I
don't want to talk about yet.

Side-Projects
=============

* [pdxburritoreview.com](https://github.com/qpfiffer/pdxburritoreview.com) -
  Pretty much exactly what it sounds like.

Regrets
=======

* I didn't handle breaking my arm very well. I didn't utilize the time and I was
just kind of in a funk for a month or two. It wasn't ideal.
* I didn't read as much as I wanted, surprise surprise.
* Bad journalling year, except for the travel sections. I'm okay with this right
  now since the documentation is good in other places, but it's nice to have a
  written account.
*

Injuries
========

* Broken arm was the biggest one
* Concussion went with the broken arm
* Pulled spinal erector
* Pulled groin muscle
* Chronic sinusitis
* Sick maybe 5-6 times?
* Chronic hamstring issue from sprinting in Myanmar
* Psoriasis from Asia, somehow.
* Lastest not Fastest inflamed something in my foot so it was impossible to run
  without pain for a few weeks
* Pulled Quad after LnF, The Rut and the Red Bull Bay Climb

That's a wrap! I'm sure more stuff will come up. I feel pretty stoked in general
so I'm not too stuck to defining objectives to finish. This year is shaping up
to be pretty involved anyway, so I'm not worried about it.
