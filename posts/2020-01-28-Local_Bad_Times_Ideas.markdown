One of the things I __really__ enjoy is fuckin' around, which I define as an
adventure that you can do from your door, that takes around a day, is poorly
planned or loosely defined, and is fully human powered. The inspiration for this
comes partly from @[jerryoftheyear](http://instagram.com/jerryoftheyear) and
partly from Brian Donnely's [From the Doorstep](https://bikepacking.com/plog/from-the-doorstep-film/) video.

To that end, it's good to have a couple different ideas to launch off on. Like
last weekend we rode out to Rocky Butte to dry-tool and then just kind of
explored. It was phenomenal. It's been raining __very__ hard the last couple
days, so I'm tempted to declare that my Beaverton water traverses are going to
start becoming possible again.

This document is intended to be a loose collection of ideas and shitty things to
do.

### The Beaverton Creek Traverse

The idea is you ride out to the [Tualatin Hills Nature Park](https://www.gaiagps.com/map/?loc=16.5/-122.8396/45.4946&pubLink=STNZw1XJl1JdbMm46v2LlFw9&waypointId=3e54425325012b3bd638c7b112473be2), do a bike ->
boat transition, and then get as far as you can. I would be psyched if we could
get to Noble Woods Park, but in reality we'd probably not even make it through
the first park. Theres a lot of bushes, trees and trash. It's a nightmare, but
it looks really fun and adventure-ish. Get out whenever and bike home.

I scoped this [previously](https://www.strava.com/activities/2769167185) and decided it wasn't really doable, but I need to
go back and look now that it's been raining pretty hard. It's too tempting to
try it, it's RIGHT THERE.

### The Tualatin River Really Long Day

This one is definitely more doable. The main idea is that you ride from home,
get to the [Farmington Paddle Launch](http://tualatinriverkeepers.org/assets/resources/trk_water_trail_map_parallelfold.pdf)
and then go as far as you can. I know Oregon City is definitely the end of the
line, because it's full of dams and this huge paper facility, but getting out
before then and riding home is completely fine. Just doing a big multi-sport day.

The thing here is I know for sure the biking would take probably an hour on
either side, but the river miles are about 30, which is huge. It'd be a massive
day. I've done some big river days before, but that was with rapids: I'm unsure
of how this river behaves. This one might need a lot of rain too, just to make
sure it's flowing quickly.
