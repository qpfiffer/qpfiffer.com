Yesterday was boring and I didn't do anything except [write some
code](http://shithouse.tv/) and buy a couple of shirts. On the other hand, today
was pretty busy.

I started off with a trip to the National Taiwan Musem, which wasn't much, to be
honest. There were some [neat
things](https://www.flickr.com/photos/104820964@N07/15145535052/) though.

After that, I followed it up with a trip out
to and on to the [Maokong Gondoloa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maokong_Gondola)
which was a nice little experience. It was incredibly hot in the actual...
gondolites? Gondolas? gondominiums? I don't know, it only cost me 50 NTD and I
bought ice cream at the end.

Got home, hung out on my computer for a while, then I played more street
fighter, and surprise surprise the [capcom pro-tour is coming to Taiwan
tomorrow](http://www.razerzone.com/capcomprotour-asia/), and I'm gonna hit that
up. I've become quite chummy with the dudes at the arcade despite the language
barrier. I got one of their LINE numbers or whatever it is, and we fight pretty
often. Good group of dudes.

After losing a bunch of money to some Blanka player, I went out and ordered
yakisoba. This was a fun little outing too because I added an egg to the meal,
which I haven't done before. This resulted in some back and forth with them
asking me how I wanted my egg done. I don't know the words for that so I
eventually just said I don't care and we moved on. Fun guys, they were all
smiling about it.

After that I ran back to the hostel and grabbed my camera because the [Taiwan
Fixed-Style meetup](https://zh-tw.facebook.com/FIXEDSTYLETEAM) happens every
Friday night and I like bikes, so.

I got there and there are some [pretty nice bikes](https://www.flickr.com/photos/104820964@N07/14961570030/) at this thing,
makes me realize I should probably put together a new one. Some nice kids ended
up approaching me for some kind of pseudo art-project where I answer a question
on a postcard and then ask one of my own, which will then show up whenever it's
shipped. Really cool actually.

Finally I ended up chatting with one guy for a while until everyone took off on
their ride, I really regret not being able to take my bike; it would've been fun.
