# Background

Tin Cup Creek is an unpaddled tributary of the Chetco River in the Klamiopsis
Wilderness of southern Oregon. It's access is both unmaintained and extremely
difficult, which is why, until now, no one has gotten in there to check it out.

Depending on what map you are looking at, a trail exists branching off from the
Chetco Divide trail and going up Tin Cup Creek proper, but in my communications
with the [Siskiyou Mountain Club](https://siskiyoumountainclub.org/) no one has
actually worked on that trail for a very long time. In the Kalmiopsis this means it
might as well not exist, due to fires and the general rugged nature of the area.

The only two logical ways to get in there, then, are via the Illinois River (and
the mysterious "Tin Cup Pass") or to do a big overland day on the Kalmiopsis Rim
Trail and drop into the headwaters somewhere. The only drawback with this is the
awful bushwhack up and over the pass from South Bend: It's steep, very dense and
completely unknown.

I'd been chatting with various people for a few years now and haven't been able
to make it happen, until I finally linked up with [Jacob
Cruser](https://mthoodh2o.blogspot.com/) on the [Minam
River](https://mthoodh2o.blogspot.com/2025/03/minam-river.html) last year and we
started talking about it. He'd actually attempted this same route years before
with hardshells and given up, so he was really the only other person in the
world that knew anything about this route. I'd emailed him in my various
campaigns before as well, so I think he knew I was serious about it.

One handshakey agreement later on that trip and we agreed to go for the logical
Illinois River -> Tin Cup Creek -> Chetco River triple. If anything, it would
be a cool link up and a first descent. How bad could the bushwhack be? The
mystery compels.
