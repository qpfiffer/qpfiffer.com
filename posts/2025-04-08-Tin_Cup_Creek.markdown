# Background

Tin Cup Creek is an unpaddled tributary of the Chetco River in the Kalmiopsis
Wilderness of southern Oregon. It's access is both unmaintained and extremely
difficult, which is why, until now, no one has gotten in there to check it out.

Depending on what map you are looking at, a trail exists branching off from the
Chetco Divide trail and going up Tin Cup Creek proper, but in my communications
with the [Siskiyou Mountain Club](https://siskiyoumountainclub.org/) no one has
actually worked on that trail for a very long time. In the Kalmiopsis this means it
might as well not exist, due to fires and the general rugged nature of the area.

The only two logical ways to get in there, then, are via the Illinois River (and
the mysterious "Tin Cup Pass") or to do a big overland day on the Kalmiopsis Rim
Trail and drop into the headwaters somewhere. The only drawback with this is the
awful bushwhack up and over the pass from South Bend: It's steep, very dense and
completely unknown.

I'd been chatting with various people for a few years now and haven't been able
to make it happen, until I finally linked up with [Jacob
Cruser](https://mthoodh2o.blogspot.com/) on the [Minam
River](https://mthoodh2o.blogspot.com/2025/03/minam-river.html) last year and we
started talking about it. He'd actually attempted this same route years before
with hardshells and given up, so he was really the only other person in the
world that knew anything about this route. I'd emailed him in my various
campaigns before as well, so I think he knew I was serious about it.

*My own visit to the confluence last year on my [Chetco trip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgCtjUbFFDw)*

One handshakey agreement later on that trip and we agreed to go for the logical
Illinois River -> Tin Cup Creek -> Chetco River triple. If anything, it would
be a cool link up and a first descent. How bad could the bushwhack be? The
mystery compels.

# Day 1

> - Jacob, musing on the nature of Tin Cup Creek before seeing it.

We met up the night before and camped out at one of the standard Chetco River
take-outs, the bridge. It had been kind of cold and we were fully immersed in a
fog bank. It would be a theme: lots of moisture.

We left soonish after waking up and drove straight to Gasquet where we picked up
a shuttle driver. He was very chatty, doing quite a lot to diminish our
apprehension about putting on the Illinois at ~3500 CFS.

Sadly, I shot quite a bit of GoPro during our Illinois descent, but the discount
SD card I bought died. I wasn't able to recover anything off of it. Never buy
the returned SD cards from Fred Meyer! We were pretty conservative given the
nature of the trip. It was good fun, and all lines went well.

We pretty much snuck every rapid: Shout out to the [Whitewater
Guidebook](https://www.whitewaterguidebook.com/oregon/illinois-river/)
page on the Illinois and some phone-beta our friend Jim sent us. The mileages
were super accurate and the descriptions were great.

*South Bend camp*

We were able to camp right at South Bend, a good ways above Green Wall, and
scout out the start to our "hike" a little bit. We spent the evening swapping
stories and drinking a little whisky.

# Day 2

*Jacob takes an opporunity to stay above the foliage*

Neither of us slept super well: cold and wet. Back in the cloud. We ate and
packed up, leaving around 9.

> "Have you read the Long Walk? It's very compelling."
> - Jacob, at one of the comically small rests we found in the brush.

There wasn't much to say or do other than to just get to it: It was horrible. I
immediately tried to lead us into Poison Oak, which wasn't blooming yet, but
Jacob knows the stuff very well and always steered us straight.

*Jacob saws through a stout little set of branches*

I'd picked up a [lightweight pull-saw](https://suluk46.com/product/yuka-240-pull-saw/) from Suluk46 just for
the trip, and it proved invaluable: if anything, just to stop and do something
other than grovel with a giant backpack on.

<img loading="lazy" src="/static/img/tin_cup/day_2_5.jpg"></img>
*Exasperated at a rest point*

It took us four hours to cover the next half-mile, and about a thousand feet of
elevation gain. The path was winding, tortuous and impossible to see. We would
fight our way up through steep, crumbling dirt and through very tight bushes
into poison oak infested pods which we would try to move around. 1 liter of
water was not enough. Every now and then we would sit in a small, rounded out
clearish area next to a burned tree and rest. It was very slow going.

<img loading="lazy" src="/static/img/tin_cup/day_2_2.jpg"></img>

Eventually we made it to leveler, clearer ground at a sort of plateau, where I
discovered my PFD had come off somewhere in the bushwhack. I didn't think it
would be too far from the top, so off I went back down the hill. It took me 40
minutes to find it, but I did.

<img loading="lazy" src="/static/img/tin_cup/day_2_3.jpg"></img>
*Re-cresting the lip of the plateau after rescuing my life jacket*

From there it was a little easier going up until the very top of the pass, but
not much. We were kind of wasted and I was definitely dehydrated. Lots of
cramping. We briefly celebrated with a snack up at the crest of the pass and then started
picking our way down. A small spring helped us get back on top of the
dehydration spiral.

The backside was better, but there were thick sections of madrones that really
slowed us down: just standing completely on branches and falling through trees
to try and gain a few feet was the name of the game. Eventually we were able to
make it to the creek: A very welcome sight.

There wasn't much of a campsite, so we had a little [coffee
paste](https://nonormal.com/), ate some snickers bars and inflated our
packrafts. We carefully scrubbed everything down with soap, because the contact
with poison oak was inevitable. Everything sacrificed to the bushwhack went into
drybags and stuffed deep into the boats.

*High hopes*

We had just enough water, and were able to pick our way down. After a portage at
Heather Creek (big log jam!) we found a nice boof, pictured above. I wasn't sure
about running it given how tired and beat up we were, but Jacob is more
experienced in these things and pointed out it might not be runnable in the
morning. We gave it a go, and it was amazing.

A few more bedrock rapids later and found a nice, giant camp that would work for
both of us near a waterfall. It didn't take us long to fall asleep.

# Day 3

<img loading="lazy" src="/static/img/tin_cup/day_3_0.jpg"></img>
*Tin Camp, photo cr. Jacob Cruser*

We were lucky and slept a lot warmer. Jacob tried to ol' alpine
Nalgene-full-of-hot-water trick and I guess it more or less worked out for him.
We weren't particularly fast out of camp, but we still managed to start
inflating boats just before 9AM.

<img loading="lazy" src="/static/img/tin_cup/day_3_4.jpg"></img>
*A nice boof mid-rapid, higher up*

Our first section was definitely different than the evening before, it opened up
and more wood was present. We had okay-lines through some marginal rapids,
and did a couple portages around strainers. There was an incredible ~5-8 foot boof that
would have been really sweet if it hand't been for the tree stuck in it.

<img loading="lazy" src="/static/img/tin_cup/day_3_2.jpg"></img>
*Boofing a nice ledge on a higher quality rapid before the step section*

At some point I had a nice pin-to-aggressive self-exit, and another random
flip-to-combat-roll, both caused by extremely sticky rocks. We were both pretty
cautious about rocky lines after that. Something about the geology and lack of
algae really makes packrafts stick to rocks in there.

Around where Darling Creek comes in the rapids became a lot more bouldery and
much steeper: We did quite a bit of portaging through here, with some nice
gems sprinkled in.

<img loading="lazy" src="/static/img/tin_cup/day_3_1.jpg"></img>
*Jacob somewhere on the second half*

I pinned again, there was more portaging, and then things tapered off to around 50FPM 
about a mile about the confluence. We had some final portages and nicer rapids into the Chetco. 
Both stoke and fatigue were high with another 15 miles of Chetco to go.

*The confluence: Tin Cup on the left, Chetco on the right*

We were definitely fading paddling through this section: the hike had really
taken it out of us. At one point we were scouting one of the last big drops
below Tollman Ranch and I could not remember what path we took to get back to
the boats. It was kind of amazing.

We made it back to the car without incident, a day ahead of schedule, and
completed the shuttle. I said goodbye to Jacob, drove through Grant's Pass to
eat a bunch of fast food and fell asleep at a rest stop. Goal achieved.

# Epilogue

I wouldn't really recommend this route to anyone: the bushwhack is insane, but
the Illinois to Chetco link-up needed to happen. I felt extremely lucky that we 
were able to make it up. I would recommend that the
ambitious hike in on the Kalmiopsis Rim Trail and drop
into the headwaters. Preferably with a good amount of water in the Chetco,
like 4k+. 

There are still mysteries to be solved in there, including
"waterfalls" of a dubious nature and quality. The Kalmiopsis Wilderness is a
special place, and it rewards those ambitious few willing to dream a little bit.
