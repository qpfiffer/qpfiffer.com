Woke up at 6 AM today, and promptly got to it. Claire wanted to go to central on
a little walk thing we found in our guidebook, so after we got showered and
ready and whatever we headed out to central.

* First time seeing central was intense. People, cars, smog, sound. People just
  unloading stuff in the street.
* Had some difficulty with the map, couldn't figure out how to get to statue
  square for a bit.
* Managed to figure out that staying up on the sky bridge is the best way to get
  around. It's pretty much a pathway that connects all of the buildings.
* Wandered into the square, started following the guidebooks directions.
* Tried to get to the 43rd floor of the HSBC tower, they didn't really like
  that.
* Hong Kong park was awesome, there is a big tower with a spiral staircase that
  I climbed up and snapped a few pictures from.
* Visited a random Aviary that we found.
* Came back, went to the IFC mall. After struggling we found where we wanted to
  eat, some noodle-ish place called Tasty. Pretty cheap, good food. We didn't
get big portions but I think it was a place where you were supposed to order a
lot of dishes and share them.
* Found an observation deck, took some pictures. The air here is pretty damn
  bad. Humidity wasn't terrible today.
* Went to Mong Kok, holy shit it is crowded. People and shops and cars
  everywhere. Very dense.
* Went to the Golden Computer Shopping Arcade
* Wandered around the flea markets and day market areas for a bit, picked up a
  sim card for $3.00. I'm not quite sure what I can do with it.
* Found the place I was looking for, Keyboard Hell. It's a mechanical keyboard
  store. Wasn't open so I didn't get to check out all of the prices, but it
seemed about the same as online.
* By this point we were both tired so we headed back to out hotel. Going to rest
  and maybe eat or something.

Observations:

* People in the morning looooove their newspapers.
* The morning rush is insane
* There are hardly any pigeons. I think I saw one.
* Cellphones eeeeeeverywhere
* Octopus card is probably the best thing in this county. You can charge it up,
  check it, use it anyway (we bought some drinks with it for like 85 cents)
* There is a lot of garbage being peddled in Sham Shui Po. Things like you'd
  find in the dollar tree or the cell phone cases bargain bin at Fred Meyers.
* There were some awesome power tools stores and random stalls at the markets
  (zip tie stall, battery stalls, recycled flourescent light bulb stall, cell
phone stalls every 10 feet)
* People love Samsung and Apple. I see Samsung smart phones everywhere.
* It's pretty hot but people are wearing pants and hoodies anyway. I'd hate to
  see this place in the summer
