This is a little tutorial on how I got the official <a
href="http://coreos.com/">CoreOS</a> image working with KVM.

Setting up the Virtual Machine
------------------------------

1. Download the image. You can get it <a href="http://storage.core-os.net/coreos/amd64-generic/dev-channel/coreos_production_qemu_image.img.bz">here.</a>
1. You need to convert the image to it's raw data so that you can extract it to
   your LVM.
```
bunzip2 coreos_production_qemu_image.img.bz2
qemu-img convert coreos_production_qemu_image.img -O raw coreos.raw
```
1. Once thats done converting, take your raw data and dd it onto your LVM.
```
dd if=coreos.raw of=/dev/lvmgroup/lvm_name
```
1. Create your machine with whatever specs you want, at the time of this writing
   the CoreOS image is about 6GB or so. I used `virt-manager` to get it done
quickly.

SSH Keys
--------

CoreOS has some funky ideas about users and ssh keys, so I had to figure out
how to pass through the keys. Turns out with virt-manager, you can add these
pretty easily through the interface.

You'll need your known `authorized_keys` file  setup beforehand, which I won't
cover. Place it somewhere your libvirt user can read and access. I threw mine in
`/var/lib/libvirt/ssh`.

Then just add the following XML to your KVM's definition, which should be in
`/etc/libvirt/qemu`.

```
<filesystem type='mount' accessmode='passthrough'>
    <source dir='/var/lib/libvirt/ssh'/>
    <target dir='metadata'/>
    <readonly/>
    <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00' slot='0x06' function='0x0'/>
</filesystem>
```

and then once thats done:

```
virsh define /etc/libvirt/machine_name.xml
```

This adds a filesystem passthrough to your virtual machine that will add a
'metadata' tag, which can be mounted. The virt-manager interface is a little
misleading in this regard.

At the end of all this, you should be able to ssh as core into your new machine.
