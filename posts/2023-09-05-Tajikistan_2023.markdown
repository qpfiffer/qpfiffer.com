In August of 2023, for our annual vacation-adventure thing we decided to go to
Tajikistan. Initially we'd planned to head to Baffin Island, but trying to get
there from the Faroe Islands was non-trivial and we didn't really know how to
deal with polar bears. We'd also really liked Kyrgyzstan last time we were there,
so we were very excited to go.

# Plan

We didn't really have any idea what we'd be doing in the country until a few
weeks ahead of time- I'd had a bunch of rivers I wanted to do, but we only really
had packrafts and that was about it. Somehow, eventually, we were tipped off to
the [Murghab River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murghob). Megan was a little
iffy about paddling anything Class IVish, and this looked relatively doable, so
we decided to try it.

A few russian teams have descended the river ([here is a good trip
report](https://www.ski.ru/az/blogs/post/murgab-bartang-1990/)) but otherwise
it's kind of unknown. A [team of
kayakers](https://pamirs.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/its-all-about-kok-jar/) have
also descended it, which gave us some good english beta. For the most part, we
didn't really know what we'd be in for: Probably lots of terrible lake miles,
some way-too-big-class-V+ that we'd have to portage, high elevation, and a lot of
beautiful scenery. Perfect.

We finally settled on a plan to paddle the river, cross Lake Sarez to the
Irkht Valley and hike out to the town of Bachor. What could go wrong?

[Pamir Trips](https://pamirtrips.com/) was instrumental in helping us figure out
a lot of the logistics. Sharaf was very helpful and responsive.

# A New Lake?

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/the_new_lake.png"></img>

I was doing some route-scoping on SentinelHub ([Thanks Luc!](https://courses.thingstolucat.com/start-and-end-at-home)) and stumbled upon a new lake
recently formed on our route, right where all of the really difficult whitewater
was supposed to be. Apparently an [earthquake](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-reports-magnitude-73-earthquake-near-border-with-tajikistan-2023-02-23/) 
in February 2023 had triggered a landslide along the river, blocking it and
damming it, not unlike Lake Sarez itself. I was able to watch via the sattelite
imaggery as the lake slowly filled, then partially released as it broke through
the top of the rubble.

This added a new complication: Parties before us had some rather exciting and
difficult portages along this section, and we had no idea how the landslide
would look once we got there. Would we be able to get over it? Would the
currents force us to stay far away? Could we come up with a plan B?

We decided to go for it anyway, with a rather awful escape plan to get up and
out of the lake if we couldn't scale the landslide. I was optimistic, Megan less
so. We made a large note of this in our trip plan document as a possible snag.

# Day 0

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_0_1.jpg"></img>

I'll skip a lot of the standard "We lived in a Land Cruiser for a week driving
to Murghab along the Pamir Highway" stuff since this is more of a trip report
and just get right to the day before we started. We, our food, all of our gear,
and our optimism made it intact to the town of Murghab, sitting at a cool 12,000
feet.

I had some altitude sickness just as we got into town and spent the rest of the afternoon
and evening in bed half asleep, but Megan managed to make some friends with a
WHO crew that was up there and had a more entertaining night.

I managed to crawl out of bed to chug water and stuff twelve days of food into
my bag, and like any good adventure, it was comically heavy. Very depressing.
Luckily we'd be on water for the first 5-6 days and it wouldn't matter so much.

Somehow in the course of all this, we realized our flight out was on the 5th, and
that we'd actually have one less day than we planned to do the whole trip.
It's a good omen when you're running late before you even start.
With little option other than to move quickly,
we decided to front-load some miles on the first day and hopefully keep our
average mileage up. We're pretty good at suffering for long chunks of time so
this wasn't too big a deal.

# Day 1

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_0_0.jpg"></img>

We got up early, ate breakfast and managed to hoof everything out to the river.
The instant coffee and porridge I had were fantastic, and my head didn't hurt so I was feeling
even better. The walk was about a mile, and it was rough with all of the weight
in the bags, but not too bad. Locals eyed us on the way down but nobody followed
us to the river.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_1_0.jpg"></img>

30 minutes after getting to the river and we were floating away. It was moving
quite quick, around four miles per hour, which was fantastic. We were going to
try and go ~28ish miles that day so that we could check out the Eli Su hot springs near 
Modiyan.

The river moved quickly and so did we- lots of scenic floating, scrubby plant life,
people out cutting the grass with scythes, horses, wild cows and sheep, and
eventually small trees once we lost enough elevation. M didn't like the cheese
she bought so I ended up taking it and eating a lot of it. Twenty miles went
down pretty quickly.

We stopped at one point while the sun was out to check out a graveyard: small
little mud buildings slowly dissolving in the harsh climate. No names or
anything, just mounds and pits or small domes. Some locals watched us float away.

As the mountains rose up around us it started to feel more remote, and we pulled
off to camp around 2PM. 29 river miles down in a few hours isn't bad at all. I wasn't
super keen on the hot springs and there wasn't a clear, short path to get there
so M went on her own. I had some afternoon coffee and headed up the creek to see
if it would be paddleable. Curious locals walked by and eyed our tent but nobody
said hi.

I bailed after it became impossible to continue without a substantial creek
crossing and had a little adventure on the way back: I fought my way up a super
steep gully, which was very tiring at twelve thousand feet, and then came back
down a road. It had started raining at this time so I was pretty soaked.

Megan didn't get back until around 8:30, and she'd had her own adventure.
Apparently the hot springs are VERY hot and they're basically in someone's home.
She didn't get in more than knee high, and it was more like a sauna. She tried
to walk back down the creek, but turned around for the same reason I did,
except she had another five miles back to camp. She put in a whole 13 miles on
foot and walked/ran back in the rain. Brutal.

We ate and went to bed around 9ish.

# Day 2

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_2_0.jpg"></img>

We woke up at six, after it rained all night. This would be a theme: Wind and
rain in the afternoons and evenings. I hadn't drank enough water and had a
headache, cool- I couldn't really eat so I just had some ibuprofen and downed a
bunch of Megan's earl grey tea, which was amazing. I felt like a real
mountaineer. The sun was out too, so things were looking up.

We packed and dragged the boats up a little ways so we could paddle the small creek we
slept next to, which was a good way to start the day. Then we managed to convince ourselves that the river
was higher, because it was much faster and there were some class II- rapids at the
put-in. It was definitely moving quickly, but I figured that we had just burned
through all the gradient for the day. It leveled off pretty soon afterward.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_2_2.jpg"></img>
*One of the side channels.*

We entertained ourslves by taking small side channels and seeing if they'd get
us around a bend faster. Usually they didn't.

At one point we came upon a giant yellow house on the side of the river. We
tried to talk to someone there but the language barrier was pretty thick. We
couldn't figure out what the house was there for or why it was so big, and couldn't locate it on google maps later, either. 
Very suspicious. Theres nothing out there so it especially stood out.

At some point we passed the end of the road that had been paralleling the river
and things felt much more remote. The mountain walls came down to the water,
but there were still no rapids. I kept expecting something surprising to show up
and grab us.

At some point we hung out on a gravel bar to eat and skip rocks and look for
interesting stones. No fossils [this time around](/posts/2022-08-30-Nahanni_2022.html), though.

We started passing through the landslides-of-old, and the lakes they had created, and
it became much hotter and slower. We skipped a good camp spot and decided to keep
going into the newly formed lake. Trees started to be swallowed by the water, and
nothing was moving anymore. 

It's very surreal to be in a steep mountain bowl
with nothing but rock and matcha-colored water all around you. Little did we
know this was just an easy predecessor of things to come.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_2_1.jpg"></img>

Towards the later afternoon we fought our way up a canyon, dragging boats and
walking through glacial silted brush to get to a shitty campsite. We went back and
forth for quite some time about camping on a high rocky bank covered in
rockfall, or a microscopic, wet gravel bar.

After examining the gravel bar (it was wet and even smaller than we thought) we
decided to go for the extremely sharp rockfall camp. We found the least deadly
spot we could and, after maybe an hour, managed to carve out a small, smooth
depression in the scree. I dubbed it Castle Quinlan. It wasn't bad but wasn't
great, either.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_2_3.jpg"></img>
*Laying down on the only flat spot on Castle Quinlan*

We ate around 5:30 and got everything setup just before the afternoon storm rolled in. This
time I drank a lot of tea before bed, hoping to stave off the headache. I read a
bit of [Living the Best Day Ever](http://livingthebestdayever.com/) which became
a nightly ritual for the trip.

Tomorrow is the big day, where we have to cross our unknown landslide wall.
Hopefully it doesn't have parapets and armed guards. It didn't take long for us
to fall asleep.

# Day 3

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_3_0.jpg"></img>
*Getting ready to leave day 2 camp*

It was windy and rainy all night but we were pretty comfy, despite pitching the
tent without the bug net insert. We heard rockfall throughout the night but it
was mostly across the canyon, or farther upstream. We survived.

When we got up and out of the tent at six, our only alternative camp site, the
gravel bar, was underwater. Good thing we moved all those rocks around instead.
We left camp by 8:30AM and headed off into the lake. Megan was paddling with her
pack balanced on the bow of her boat in case we had to do some steep ascent to
get out of the water and over the landslide.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_3_1.jpg"></img>
*Bow-baggin'*

After about 90 minutes and what we _thought_ was a lot of wind, we made it to
the dam. We took one break about halfway through at another landslide protruding
into the water to eat and drink before rounding the final corner to our unknown
obstacle.

The first thing we noticed was that everything was covered in a fine gray dust-
it filled the whole basin. We were also pleasantly surprised to see that our
plan B would probably go if we needed it to, but it was a steep uphill climb
through a rock-filled gully. Not really ideal.

Luckily for us, it was easy to get out and inspect the new slide. It was also
easy to walk around on- it was completely filled in with the same moon-dust
coating the walls. We got up and looked at the water bursting through the other
side, which was as crazy as you can imagine, then went to the boats and packed
everything up for what was, surprisingly, an easy portage.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_3_2.jpg"></img>
*Me somewhere in the moon field*

It was only about a quarter mile or so, and it wasn't even that bad. We'd both
been expecting way worse. We blew up the boats again at the bottom and paddled out on the
first real whitewater we'd seen in the whole trip. The water was coming through
over the dam (colored green) and through it at the bottom (colored bright blue)
and then mixing again into an azure. It was very pretty, and wildly different than
the dirty green from up above the dam.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_3_3.jpg"></img>
*Packing back up to paddle away from the dam.*

We briefly lost eachother after I stopped to take some photos of Megan paddling
out, but then joined back up for some fast-moving water through flooded brush
fields. A pleasant float after paddling hard on the lake for a while.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_3_4.jpg"></img>
*Megan paddles out on some busy class II-III after the portage*

We stopped to investigate some rusty things we saw along the shore and ended up
wandering around the abandoned hydrometeorological station for a while. I don't
have any good photos of this since I only had my GoPro, but Megan got a ton- it
was like everyone just up & left after the collapse of the soviet union.
Everything was bent and twisted and full of silt like it had been flooded. I
talked Megan out of keeping one of the cool little brown bottles we found after
she picked one up that still had mercury in it. I'm pretty sure there was
asbestos around the pipes, too. A cool place, but spooky.

After eating something and putting back on the river, we started noticing weird,
blackened walls that looked like they had slid or something- only after seeing
them repeatedly did we realize they were just the dirty ends of glaciers. It was
really, really cool to paddle right next to them

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_3_5.jpg"></img>
*Looking at a crazy scimitar-shaped iceberg in the middle of the river.*

From there we had some bigger rapids, maybe class III+ and we portaged a bigger
IVish drop that snuck up on us. A big IV around a corner had us stop for the
evening in a big flat-ish bank with some good boulders to hide behind should the
rockfall fairy visit in the night. It had been a very full day.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_3_6.jpg"></img>
*My beautiful rock wall*

Camp was almost perfect, but the wind kicked up so the one time we wanted to
have a fire ended up being a hide-in-the-tent night. I spent the evening
drinking coffee, reading and moving rocks around the edge of the tent to try and
hide from the wind.

# Day 4

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_4_0.jpg"></img>

The weather was beautiful in the morning, and it was great to watch the sun
creep down the canyon walls. I memorized a line through the big rapid and
decided to run it, and M found an okay put-in just downstream. I aced my line and
we were soon on our way, leaving one of the better camp-spots. It felt good to
work a harder rapid on a remote trip and have it turn out exactly how I expected
it to. It would end up being the hardest rapid on the trip.

From there we had around five miles of read-and-run class III rapids with some
bigger holes, but it tapered off after the one we'd camped at. The scenery
was mostly blue water, dustland, some green grass and scrubby trees.

Another landslide showed up and blocked our view of what sounded like a big
rapid, so we ended up portaging it. This would be the last rapid before the
[lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarez_Lake), and we paused to eat for a while. 
After snacking for a bit, we paddled the run out and started paddling down the lake.

I was optimistic that we could build a raft out of driftwood and the packrafts
to hopefully gain some speed since there were sticks everywhere, but I'd later
realize that they were only at this end of the lake because thats where
the wind pushed them. There would be no other wood until our take-out, 35 miles
later.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_4_1.jpg"></img>

We paddled for ages. The wind picked up in the afternoon and it only got way
worse. We stopped once for a potential campspot because the going was so rough,
and M wanted to bail for a highroute but I convinced her to keep going. After
that the wind _really_ picked up and _I_ wanted to bail, but she convinced me to
keep going instead.

It's hard to overstate how bad the wind and the rain were. They absolutely
whipped us going around corners. I could go a little faster than M so I was
making oh, one mile per hour? She was somewhere under that. It was insane. We'd
paddle from wall to wall along the lake, hardly moving at all, then a gust would
hit us and we'd shelter, then we'd hide in a little eddie, then do it all over
again. It was very slow going.

Eventually we spotted land we could potentially get up onto (since the walls were
so steep everywhere), but a beach surprised us before we even got there. We arrived on this
fantastic little oasis around 7:00pm, and _immediately_ upon landing the wind stopped,
the lake became glassy and the clouds cleared. We could see all the 6000 meter
peaks around us, with fresh snow on top. It was savage, and we were absolutely
tired.

We ate and went to bed. We slept well until the tent partially collapsed and I
had to walk around in the dark looking for rocks to prop everything back up.

# Day 5

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_5_0.jpg"></img>
*Morning on our little miracle beach. Notice fresh snow in the mountain tops.*

Perhaps traumatised by our awful, million-hour paddle from the day before, Megan
suggested we wake up at 4AM. While we were awake earlier, we were also a little
slower in leaving camp and didn't head out until around 7AM.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_5_1.jpg"></img>

We paddled all day. It wasn't bad at first, just a big treadmill with a minor
headwind and clear skies, but it got bad later. Megan's boat paddles like a
sheet of plywood, so it was much more tiring to move. We passed the time with 20
questions, I spy, and other little games. I even came up with a song
I've already forgotten.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_5_2.jpg"></img>

We paddled and stopped a few times for snacks or Peanut Butter Tortillas. There
weren't any great places to stop, just shallow little sand pits on the side of
scree slopes. We tried not to linger as rocks and dirt slid down around us.

I was frustrated, Megan was in pain, and times were rough, but we made it
through eventually. We found a weird little nook and managed to scramble up to a
plateau, where we ate in the sun and decided to call it for the day
despite not having gone super far. We kept double-guessing the decision when the
lake would go flat, but decided there was no other place to camp in the near
future. 7AM to 2PM isn't too bad, right?

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_5_3.jpg"></img>
*Megan lounging on the perfect boulder*

It turned out to be a good spot, and we spent the evening wandering around
looking at small rocks. Megan found a really cool little crystal, and we decided
to pitch the tent on the ridge despite the wind picking up later. It was an
absolute pain to haul everything up there, but we were thankful for the flat
ground. I somehow managed to spill my dinner, but it was still
dry so I managed to get every single dehydrated noodle back into the bag.
Calories are calories!

We were in bed by 6:15PM.

# Day 6

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_6_0.jpg"></img>
*A petroglyph of two mountain ibexes*

We slept in just a little longer, until 5 AM, but managed to leave around seven.
While wandering around in the morning looking for my buff (which probably blew
away) I spotted the above petroglyph- our only one of the trip. It was
especially cool because the lake we're on has only existed for about a hundred
years, so whoever made it was tromping around WAY up high in the mountains
looking for dinner. Very cool to connect with someone back that far in history. There are [many more
petroglyphs in Tajikistan](https://silkadv.com/en/content/rock-art-tajikistan)
so it was fun to find our own.

I started off the day paddling Megan's boat, which was pretty hard work, for about two
hours and forty-five minutes. I was unhappy and sore when we finally stopped
seven miles later to eat and trade boats.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_6_1.jpg"></img>
*Yours truly suffering through the flatwater*

We traded boats and immediately afterward the wind stopped- like dead quiet. It
was fantastic. We made good time from there down to the Irkht valley and the
second meteorlogical station of the trip. It was wild to paddle across the lake
when it was flat, because there was no frame of reference- light bent around the
edges of the water so you couldn't really tell if you were moving or not. Still,
it was a welcome break from the constant assault of the wind.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_6_2.jpg"></img>
*Flatwater with no wind- amazing*

We arrived to our take-out early afternoon, where a dog and the one-eyed
caretaker met us. The dog hung around but the caretaker left us alone after we
unpacked and set up camp. There were a lot of bugs, but an easy campsite was
also very much appreciated.

We spent the evening wandering around the valley, inspecting the various
dwellings in states of disrepair. Lots of stone houses slowly returning to stone
piles, and mud houses dissolving into the earth. Broken glass everywhere.

We both ate too much sausage and ended up giving some to the dog, which might
have been a mistake.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_6_3.jpg"></img>
*An old mud and stick house falling apart*

# Day 7

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_7_0.jpg"></img>
*Megan with her pack and our new dog friend*

We set the alarm for 5AM but snoozed for 30 seconds and got up at 6AM instead. We
were packed and moving by 8. The bags were heavy, but not impossibly so. We
made pretty good time for the first few miles, but slowed down when the terrain
became worse. Lots of marshy mud, interspersed with walking through boulder
fields. The boulder fields would become a staple for the next four days.

The dog surprised us, and kept following along, even with a few river crossings. We
fed him cheese and sausage, which he liked. Megan slipped a few cookies in there
too. He was a little trooper.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_7_1.jpg"></img>
*Megan hops a side stream*

It was pretty slow going, and we stopped to drink often. I slowed down
considerably after we punched back above 12,000 feet, but Megan just kept right
on stomping ahead. The 400 calorie instant latte I bought cut the sting just a
little bit, but it was still tough. We passed some very cool granite gorges with tall, slim waterfalls in
them and lots of little side valleys. Naturally these are impossible to
take good photos of with a phone.

After ten miles of varied, hard, uphill terrain, we can't decide where to sleep 
and eventually end up on a flat, sandy bank near a small river. It's acceptable but not awe-inspiring. 
At least we have access to water. We're both dead-tired and
it's not hard to fall asleep, even after drinking an evening cup of coffee.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_7_2.jpg"></img>
*Our sweet boy after a long day of hiking through the heat*

The dog curls up and shivers through the night without complaint.

# Day 8

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_8_0.jpg"></img>
*The team snoozing on a rock near one of the many alpine lakes*

I struggle to get out of bed, as for once my decade-old sleeping bag is nice and
warm. The moon had been crazy bright, so I was in and out of sleep all night long.

The day starts with a bang, as M crashes and burns in the first river crossing:
we'd taken our pants off to avoid getting anything wet, and she ends up with
some nice shin rash. Luckily theres no real damage and we patch her up and
continue moving.

The day is markedly different than the others, with some cloud cover, rain and
even a little bit of snow. I learned my lesson back in Kyrgyzstan and brought an
actual rain jacket this time, so I was adequately covered.
It's nice and chilly while we move but we warm up.

I'm moving a little faster than the day before, but we gain another two thousand
feet so all my cardio progress at alitutde is moot. We pass through a sheperd
camp, which is interesting, but nobody invites us in and we make it through
without any angry sheepdogs chasing us. Theres a really cool feature near the
sheperd camp where the rock cuts straight through a wall and out the other side,
its like a gateway into the valley.

It doesn't take long before we top out and we're walking through an alpine
field, passing lakes as we hike up towards our high point. I'm moving _very_
slowly, and the packs are exhausting. We stop and eat some tortilla + peanut
butter, and nap for a minute in the sun. It's very nice.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_8_1.jpg"></img>

Eventually we make it to camp for the night, around 14,500 feet. The wind comes
and goes, with some light snow sprinkling, but it's pleasant aside from the
trash everywhere. It kinda sucks when you work super hard to get up somewhere
and theres just empty cans all over the place.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_8_2.jpg"></img>
*Megan builds the dog a little windblock*

We're both absolutely wasted, and fall asleep quickly. After my evening
adventure coffee, of course.

# Day 9

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_9_0.jpg"></img>
*One of the million bright blue alpine lakes we passed*

It's our final day of going up, but we're largely trending down. We assumed it
would go fast. We gave the dog more sausage, but we were starting to run low.
The packs feel lighter, but stil very, very heavy. It feels silly to carry all
this heavy paddling gear up so high.

After passing through lower Vikhinj pass, we thought we'd be in the clear, but
we're mostly walking on wobbly rock. The morraine that we'd pass through was
especially difficult. It was, however, really cool to watch the river just completely disappear into
the rock- totally gone. We would hear it echoing up sometimes through the
rock as we wandered through the rifts and valleys of it.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_9_1.jpg"></img>
*Walking along near the gorge below the morraine*

I felt a lot better as we descended and was able to keep up with Megan and the
dog (who didn't like to walk behind me because I was slow) and was infatuated
with this class V gorge that emerged next to us. It started off okay looking but
ended in a crazy, sieved out drop with huge boulders in it. Very cool.

At some point our little spirit animal rolled in a dead cow along the trail so
we had to give him some space, but we all made it to camp together. I don't
think I've ever felt such a deep fatigue. At least [Sockdolager](https://sockdolagerequipment.com/)
makes a comfortable pack so it wasn't too bad.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_9_2.jpg"></img>
*Are we tired of alpine lakes yet?*

Camp was a marked spot near a hot spring, so Megan was psyched. We are, again,
totally exhausted, despite walking downhill. I eat chunks of sausage and feed
the rest of it to the dog. We're optimistic about paddling out, but I'm not so
sure, it looks steep.

# Day 10

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_10_0.jpg"></img>
*The dog finds half of a marmot to eat on the trail*

The final day- Megan wakes up super early to hike up to the hot springs. I hide
in the tent for a while sipping coffee, before hiking a few miles sans-pack to
check out our potential escape river. It looks steep, stiff and very fast so I
make the decision not to run it. Luckily we have some of the best trail of the
entire trip along the river, so we end up moving quickly.

Megan eventually comes back down from the hot springs (which are apparently very
cool, way high up the canyon) and we head out.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_10_1.jpg"></img>
*Hiking out along the river*

We spend the day eyeing rapids, walking along the trail, baking in the sun and
stopping to eat. It's not bad, and we make pretty good time.

<img src="/static/img/tajikistan_2023/day_10_2.jpg"></img>
*Basking in a trail-side spring*

We have to do a fairly serious river crossing towards the end of the day, so we
think it's finally going to be time to say goodbye to the dog, but he ends up
making it as well in a dramatic, disney-style moment. We're all pretty psyched
on the last few miles into Bachor.

We wander around for a little while before contacting Sharaf over at Pamir Trips
to send us a driver, and we're invited in to stay with a family in the village.
It's nice since there was a big group ahead of us and we weren't sure where we'd
be able to spend the night.

We eat our fill of cookies, fruit, potatoes, bread and drink more tea than you
can imagine. The family is very nice and we have a good time before falling
asleep at nine. Adventure completed.

Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoy the write-up. Thanks to [Sockdolager](https://sockdolagerequipment.com/) for a
great pack, Sharaf for running logistics, and Megan for still wanting to be
married. It was a difficult trip, but not a hard one, and I am immensely
proud of it. Heres to many more adventures in central asia in the future.

Oh, and the dog is, as far as we know, living a happy, wild life in the town of
Bachor. The last we saw he was making friends with a boy and some other dogs.
