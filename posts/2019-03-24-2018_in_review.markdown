"Nothing is Ideal" - Zybin

Accomplishments
===============

What an AWESOME year. All over the place, but I did a lot of things I've never
done before, and felt a lot of things I've never felt before.

### General

* Found somebody I really like
* Shaved my legs a couple times
* Quit my job

### Racing/Bikes

* [Tracklocross came and went](https://www.instagram.com/p/BhsnUF9B6QU/)
* Won the [gold sprints](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bk-eDHFBWdz/) right before bone machine, beating all the out of
  towners. It's the only bike skill I'm really good at.
* Finally bought a [mountain bike](https://salsacycles.com/bikes/timberjack/2018_timberjack_gx1_27.5)
* Visited my grandmother in NY and raced BMX in jeans. Way more fun than I
  thought it would be.
* Made it to Cat 2 in track
* PB'd my 200m sprint at 12.20. The track record is 11.06.
* Raced my bike all summer, in three different velodromes. Victoria, Seattle and
  PDX.
* Went to Mission Crit V (best race of my life). Very emotional.
* Re-attempted the [Oregon Outback](http://www.bikepacking.com/routes/oregon-outback/) 
  solo, failed it, had a [WONDERFUL time](https://www.instagram.com/p/BnZUn3chq8v/).
* [Rode out to the coast](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bm-S3TNB1qM/), overnighted, and came back
* Underground COBRA race [was pretty rad](https://www.instagram.com/p/BegYJjwH7N1/), too. Did poorly but had too much fun.
* Mountain biked all over the place, but [the triple](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bkq4FHXhADA/) was especially memorable. Syncline,
  Post Canyon and Sandy Ridge.

### Adventure

* Completed a 10-Day silent meditation retreat in Yangon, Myanmar.
* Rode the train to Klamath Falls for no reason, then rode it back. Thanks Bryan.
* Tried escape rooms for the first time. We've done three, I think we've passed
  two.
* Travelled to New York for 18 hours to see Lightning Bolt, Show me the Body play.
* Had a [great match against Jake](https://www.instagram.com/p/BisretfBY7U/) (way bigger than me!), 
  getting my boxing skills back up. [Bonus, the stomp.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BiNEt1Hhgk6/)
* Attended the [Gambler 500](https://www.instagram.com/p/BlRcRE6hYr6/) for the
  first time.
* Trekked to Everest Basecamp (as well as the [three passes](https://ebctrekguide.com/three-passes-trek-everest-base-camp))
* Travelled the world. Made it to five different countries before our
  round-the-world trip was over (Pakistan, China, Dubai, Nepal, Myanmar,
  Thailand). It continued into 2019, but thats for next year.
* [Bungee jumped](https://www.instagram.com/p/BqOwtI8l6T1/)
* Bought a [packraft](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bm1OlmXBio3/), took a
  whitewater class and ran parts of three different rivers (Clackamas, Truckee, American)
* Went to EVO2018, even though I don't play fighting games anymore. Kind of a
  whole hilarious misstep.

### Climbing

* It was a good year for climbing. I climbed in Leavenworth, Lake Tahoe, Smith Rock (Bend, OR) and Thailand. 
  We climbed a lot on the SE Asia tour, but most of it was in 2019.
* Led (Onsite, too) a 6B+ (In Vietnam) outside.
* Crack climbed for the first time

### Strength/Fitness

* Deadlifted 405 pounds (!!!) on 2/28. Thanks Bryan.
* Did my [longest endurance day](https://www.strava.com/activities/1734601743) in Lake Tahoe with Megan. We
  ran/walk/power-hiked 26 miles for 14 hours, with almost 10,000ft of gain.
  Nightmare, but awesome. Very hard.

### Books

I read a lot of books on the trip, but some were in 2019. I've only included the
titles from 2018 here. I think "Open" by Agassi was my favorite - it's a
fantastic book and a pageturner.

Side-Projects
=============

N/A

Regrets
=======

* It was a weird year for journalling. Some spots are filled in, some arent. I
  managed to journal almost every day on the SE Asia trip, though.
* NO RAGRETS

Goals from Last Year
====================

Failed all of them! To be fair my write-up for 2017 was pretty half-assed. I
didn't really have many goals at all.

* <span class="fail">Failed</span>Squat 300+ Lbs.
* <span class="fail">Failed</span>Bivvy at least once a month
* <span class="fail">Failed</span>Get the second MR2 up and running
* <span class="fail">Failed</span>Journal Every Day
* <span class="fail">Failed</span>Read a book a month
* <span class="fail">Failed</span>Attend a rally/rallycross event

Goals for 2019
==============

A lot of these goals were kept in a list on my phone as we were on the SE Asia
tour. It's wonderful what being deprived of any kind of distraction will do to
your ability to prepare for the future. Are you READY FOR THIS ONE?

```
I will attack my goals with certainty and discipline.
AVOID SELF-INDULGENT BEHAVIOR
DONT GET COMPLACENT
I will spend time each day toward accomplishing one or all of them.
Money spent on a goal is not moeny wasted.
Time spent learning is worth it.
```

Injuries
========

Wanted to try this one this year. It's easy to forget how messed up you get over
the course of a year so I wanted to try and remember.

* IT Band Syndrome
* Cracked rib (boxing)
* Black eye (boxing)
* 2nd Degree burns on hand (from hot tea at the 10-day retreat)

I guess I didn't get hurt too badly this year. Lots of nagging little injuries
though.
