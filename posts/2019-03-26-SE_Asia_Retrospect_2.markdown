## Dubai, UAE

<img src="/static/img/se_asia_2018_2019/dubai_1.jpg"></img>

It was a weird day. We left Islamabad in the morning, had some coffee and food,
used our credit cards for the first time in a while, and just tried to recover
from the exhaust fumes. The Islamabad airport is really nice, and we had no
issues getting out. I finished [Idoru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idoru) 
along the way. Again.

The Dubai airport was exceptional, though. As you'd imagine of one of the
ritchest countries on earth, their airport relfects this. Huge duty-free areas,
lots of shiny things, soft, warm lighting; that kind of thing. We stayed just
long enough to get our bags and sync up with our Couchsurfing host, and to
connect with Tom, a friend of Megan's.

That first night we just kind of ogled the city and the sand from the lightrail,
and then met up with a friend-of-a-friend of Megan's, Tom. We also met up with our host. 
Tom is great, one of those quietly funny people with great energy. Our host was less
fun. We didn't really get along, and another couchsurfer showed up at his place at 3AM. 
Theres a lot to say about staying with him, but I'm not going to bother.
It was really hard to sleep at his place and kind of awkward so we spent very little 
time there; as little as we could.

We were only in Dubai for five days, and we really badly wanted to get out at the end. 
It feels like Vegas, but just a little bigger and ballsier.

We did meet up with another really cool guy there, Mo, from Couchsurfing and he
showed us around for the day. We walked all over, checked out the sunset, hit up
a beach (with the saltiest water I've ever accidentally tasted) and had a great
lunch in old Dubai. Our nights with our Couchsurfing host continued to be kind
of miserable, it was realy hard to sleep and just __weird__ in general.

We did spend another day at a beach, which was alright, but super
touristy. We went to a Five Guy's Burgers place and payed some stupid amount for
a basic meal. Dubai is not our favorite place.

One pretty fun thing was our stay in the desert. We booked, kind of randomly, a
[desert-camel-sunset-tour-thing](https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/232274). It
seemed fun and harmless, and it was a personal favorite. We were promised
camels, sunset, sunrise, eagle holding, arabic coffee, dates,
a couple of shows (maybe one with *fire*?), breakfast, dinner,
sandboarding, and something called dunebashing. Dunebashing was not explained,
nor really obvious, so it remained a point of exciting mystery.

We'd spent all day walking around in the sun, (In Dubai, no less).
This was a total mistake, and we were totally cooked. 
We had been looking for a public beach someone had told us about, but it turned
out to be some kind of bizarre singles bar/resort/beach combo, so we went in and 
then immediately left. Our AirBnB experience host picked us up right from there, 
so we were able to hop into an air-conditioned SUV and cool down for a while. 
We abandoned poor Tom to the metro. He's a trooper.

After driving out into the desert for a while, along roads that are sort of
covered with sand, sort of not, we arrived at a little ATV place. Neither of us
were really willing to pay to go roll around in the dunes for a while, so we
just hung out for a bit. After a little whlie, we hopped back into our Escalade
with the mysterious leather-covered bolt-in roll cage and headed into the dunes
for dunebashing.

If you've never dunebashed before, you're probably like us in that you had no
idea what it was. Someone had aired the tires way down on the car, and our
driver kicked on some eurotrance stuff and told us to buckle in (but didn't
check if we actually were) and just went for it.

He drove us up dunes, down dunes, sideways over dunes, weird turns and carefully
timed cinematic drops, it was great, but after 15 minutes or so we were all kind
of over it and a little bit nauseous. I think Megan lost the cap to her water
bottle and had to cover it with her hand the whole time. We shared the cab with
these three American girls who were exhausted from a day in Dubai, they looked a
little rougher than we felt.

Eventually the eurotrance quieted down and we parked the escalade next to the
burned out husk of another one. Our driver was curiously silent about this, I
felt concerned but no one else seemed to care. From there our driver 
pulled out a couple ratty
snowboards and we proceeded to ride them down the dunes a couple times. If you
can't tell this is the "sandboarding" we were promised. We also
got some nice pictures in the sand, very posed and pretty. Lots of footprints in
the sand, hand-holding, that kind of thing. It was fun.

From there we quieted down and drove out to where we would be staying the night.
We enjoyed a small meal of dates and little fried donut-like things and [arabic
coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_coffee), which was delicious. 
We even got to hold a hunting eagle for a second. It was kind of surreal, 
all of these things together.  We then
hopped on some camels for something like 10 minutes right before sundown,
then headed into a podunk little compound crammed with people.

We spent the night eating a pretty good, way-too-huge meal, getting some SICK
HENNA TATTOOS (I got a scorpion), getting decked out in traditional garb and
watching a couple interesting dances. Lots of spinning and swords, but no fire
dancing.

Eventually literally everyone left except Megan and I, which was kind of
unexpected. We went from 150 or so other people laughing and drinking and
smoking [shisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookah) to just us and a single
chaperone, Mufeed.

We checked out our air-conditioned room, which was amazing, then Mufeed brought
us out to smoke shisha, which was really interesting. He asked us what flavor we
wanted; we had no idea and chose Grape. This was a poor decision, apparently, so
he told us instead to smoke Apple-mint (I think. It was some combo like that). He then 
very adamantly demanded we got some smoke-blowing pictures, which we kept
screwing up and having to redo. I've never smoked anything before, and I tried it based 
only on the assurances that there was no tobacco in it. I definitely inhaled too much and 
felt really nasty for a couple minutes.

From there we went out and hung out on the dunes for a while and just talked
with Mufeed, who had a lot to say about tourists and attitude and exploration
and his work, and where he was from and his family and all sorts of stuff. Megan
and I were exhausted so we kind of cut it short, but he got some interesting
photos of us covered in sand.

That little air-conditioned room was the best sleep we'd had in days, and we
didn't want to get up, but we went outside at something like 5:00AM so we could
watch the sunrise. This was funny because it was almost totally blocked out by clouds.
We at least rode camels out there (which are tall, terrifying creatures by the way) and 
had some more Arabic coffee. 

A quick sidenote about Arabic coffee: it's served in comically cups, and
you're only supposed to fill them up about halfway, so you're drinking about a
shot of very-weak clove-scented coffee at a time. Theres also something about
using your right hand (at least I think it was your right), so you end up with a
lot of ceremony and a lot of pouring and not very much coffee.

We hopped in a car after a massive breakfast and snoozed all the
way back into town. Our driver was kind of hilarious and had this weird, chirpy
voice.

We spent our last real day in Dubai wandering around with Tom- Megan wanted to check out
the [absurd indoor ski hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_Dubai), so we went 
to the mall that houses it. It turned
out to be stupidly expensive and kind of small, so we just hung out at a TGI
Fridays and watched tourists gracefully tumble down the indoor slope.

I wanted coffee and we needed to do some more planning, so we rode and walked
over to [Box Park](), which is a really interesting street where the buildings
are all created from old shipping containers. Very boutique and bougie. Megan
and I shared an $10.00 latte and hung out with Tom painting coffee cups before
getting down to it.

I really dislike this kind of planning, but its a necessary evil so we did it.
Things like e-visas, plane tickets, places to stay, couchsurfing request- it
takes hours and it's exhausting. Megan has the patience and discipline for it
but I just get antsy and grumpy. I ended up going for a walk up and down the
street later.

We got out of there eventually after doing some more inane internet stuff, and
Tom told us fun stories from different places he'd been all over the world; like
trying to cross a roundabout in Egypt and how terrifying it was. He'd also gone
out and bought Megan and I some hilariously bad shirts for like $1.00 each-- I
wore mine unironically for a while. It violated my three shirt policy though, so
I tossed it later in Thailand. We took the train and bus back to our 
couchsurfing host's place, packed up and left.

We were all so tired on the train we fell asleep and missed our stop. Luckily
theres a bus at the terminal we ended up at back to the one we actually wanted,
so we only wasted a little time. Next stop: Kathmandu.

# Nepal

Having not slept much, our travel night to Nepal was nuts. We ended up sleepig
on the floor of a food court for a while; I was doing well sleeping with just my
towel and earplugs but woke up really cold. Megan just ground it out with a
sleeping bag, Tom slept sitting up at a table. `#justtravelthings`

Tom got us some snacks, we checked in through a hoard of people all traveling to
New Delhi, and we snoozed more at the gate. Megan and I both slept the whole
flight.

I'm gonna gloss over our time in the Indian airport because it was terrible.
Inefficient, heavy nihilism, random needless detours-- all that good stuff 
that comes with a supremely bureaucratic immigration setup. We made it through
pretty cranky and hungry. We ate a lot of pringles. We eventually got on the
plane to Nepal and out of there.

More shitty sleep, but we arrived i nthe KTH airport with little trouble.
Everything was kind of dirty and podunk, and our bags took forever to show up.
There was a brief panic when I thought someone had grabbed my bag, but it turns
out the guy just had the same model. [Osprey](https://www.osprey.com/) is super popular over here.
