## Dubai, UAE

It was a weird day. We left Islamabad in the morning, had some coffee and food,
used our credit cards for the first time in a while, and just tried to recover
from the exhaust fumes. The Islamabad airport is really nice, and we had no
issues getting out. I finished [Idoru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idoru) 
along the way. Again.

The Dubai airport was exceptional, though. As you'd imagine of one of the
ritchest countries on earth, their airport relfects this. Huge duty-free areas,
lots of shiny things, soft, warm lighting; that kind of thing. We stayed just
long enough to get our bags and sync up with our Couchsurfing host, and to
connect with Tom, a friend of Megan's.

That first night we just kind of ogled the city and the sand from the lightrail,
and then met up with Tom and our host. Tom is great, one of those quietly funny
people with great energy. Our host was a little more annoying, and another
couchsurfer showed up at his place at 3AM. He also had this awful cat that would
meow non-stop from like 4AM onwards. It was really hard to sleep in there and
kind of awkward so we spent very little time at his place; as little as we
could.

I'm gonna gloss over a lot of Dubai. We were only there for five days, and we
really badly wanted to get out at the end. It feels like Vegas, but just a
little bigger and ballsier.

We did meet up with another really cool guy there, Mo, from Couchsurfing and he
showed us around for the day. We walked all over, checked out the sunset, hit up
a beach (with the saltiest water I've ever accidentally tasted) and had a great
lunch in old Dubai. Our nights with our Couchsurfing host continued to be kind
of miserable, it was realy hard to sleep and just __weird__ in general.

We did spend another day at a beach, which was alright, but it was super
touristy. We went to a Five Guy's Burgers place and payed some stupid amount for
a basic meal. Dubai is not our favorite place.

One pretty fun thing was our stay in the desert. We booked, kind of randomly, a
[desert-camel-sunset-tour-thing](https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/232274). It
seemed fun and harmless, and it was a personal favorite.
