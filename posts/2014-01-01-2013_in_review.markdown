Accomplishments
===============

I started boxing and stuck with it. This is probably one of the most valuable
things of 2013.

I attempted and failed to learn both Japanese and Mandarin. At least with
Mandarin I'm remedying this by going back to school.

I travelled earlier in the year to New York, and in October to [Hong Kong.](/posts/2013-10-21-Hong_Kong_Day_0)

I built [this site](https://github.com/qpfiffer/qpfiffer.com),
[merveill.es](http://merveill.es/) and started [kyoto.io](http://kyoto.io/).

I improved my Haskell knowledge by building projects like [whatbook
(unfinished)](https://github.com/qpfiffer/whatbook) and [gather](https://github.com/qpfiffer/gather).

I think I read good dozen or so books this year (not enough!).

I went through three different phones.

I got into board games a bit, best of 2013 being [Twilight Imperium Third
Edition](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12493/twilight-imperium-third-edition).

Going to Hong Kong spurred on a delightful period of photography that I hope
continues into the future.

There were also a slew of personal projects that I haven't bothered to write-up,
or haven't yet.

Goals for 2014
==============

* Get a driver's license
* Get a comfortable grasp on Mandarin
* Start writing Haskell for someone, for money
* More travelling (Singapore, Murmansk, Tokyo)
* Keep boxing (work on footwork)
* Start a business and make some money on the side
* Place in [fpcomplete monthly contest](https://www.fpcomplete.com/business/resources/competition-overview/)
