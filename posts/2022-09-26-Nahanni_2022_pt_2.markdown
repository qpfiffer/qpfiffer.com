[Read part one first.](/posts/2022-08-30-Nahanni_2022.html)

This part of the trip is from day six through day twelve, our time in the
[cirque.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirque_of_the_Unclimbables).

# Day 6

We had a semi-relaxed morning in camp and were more or less on our way up to the
cirque proper by 9:00AM. We took a good picture of all of us standing in front
of our comically large/heavy bags before heading out, trying to hide from the
mosquitoes before going into the woods. I'd thought the load in the bag the day
before was heavy, but with ~7 days of food, climbing gear and a 100 meter static
rope, the bag was REAL BAD.

We split into two groups and started making our way up the ~2500 feet necessary
to get to camp. The first couple miles were fine, and Dirk managed to find some
edible mushrooms for dinner. Every time we stopped we were swarmed by mosquitoes
though, so I wasn't super excited. We took a break just before the trail got
really steep, which was nice, and I got out trekking poles. They helped a lot.

After a few hours of slogging, sweating, stumbling and general misery, we made
it to the top. We were all a little confused, since every single trip report
we'd read mentioned that the traverse along the scree slope under Mt.
Harrison-Smith was the worst part of the approach, but we hadn't even touched
it. We'd later learn that the park service had put in a nice trail, which is
what we'd been on. Nice! Nobody mentions this anywhere, of course. All told it
took us 5-6 hours to get to the top from Glacier Lake.

*Home sweet home*

It was drizzling a little when we finally made it up to the beautiful alpine
wonderland of the fairy meadows, but the advance party (M/Whitney/Mitch) had
found a good campspot for us under an overhanging rock. It was a really cool
hang-out spot, and a few climbers before us had built little tables, chairs and
wind-breaks out of stacked stones. There were even some places to hang things
off the ground so [marmots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot) couldn't get to them.

Jason Magness had told us to look around the cirque for leftover food from
previous parties, and I was starting to feel greatly depleted from the calorie
defecit, so I did just that. The park service left a bunch of metal crates up
there to keep food from being eaten while people were away, and a lot of people
just ditch food up there. I was greatful for whatever was left, which was mostly
sardines and a single jar of peanut butter. Calories are calories!

I did make the mistake of not cleaning the sardine tin very well, and my food
smelled like dead fish for the rest of the trip. Oh well. Whitney gave me some
extra instant coffee and I was pretty happy.

Whitney and M had some disagreement over how to do the climb, with M favoring a
more alpine approach, but after talking with a guided party of three in a
neighboring rock warren, we all decided on a 2-ish day attempt on [Lotus Flower Tower.](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105905652/lotus-flower-tower)

We'd gone over to talk to them since we saw them looking pretty haggard and
trudging in from somewhere, and all of their stuff was wet. Turned out their
weather window had gone bad and they'd been snowed on during the upper pitches
of the climb, and bailed. They gave us good beta on the conditions up there,
including the difficulty and how wet things were probably going to be.

Megan asked them how hard it was and they all just looked at eachother and
laughed. It was funny and a little worrying. We all decided that night to spend
tomorrow putting up the static line I'd hauled up, then go for a 2-day attempt
the day after, with a bivvy in the middle. Our weather window kind of forced us
into that plan, but we all were more or less psyched on it.

For once, the mosquitos mostly left us alone. I was very happy about it. We all
retired to the tents and kind of did our own thing in the evening, M worried
about a burgeoning overuse injury in her arm. Ibuprofen would be her best friend
through the next few days, but she didn't know if she'd be able to do the climb.
As usual, the sun was up for way too long and it felt like it never truly got
dark.
