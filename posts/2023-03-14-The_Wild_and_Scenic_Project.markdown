# Whats the project?

I like to do big efforts, big projects, weird missions. I love whitewater. I
love kayaking, and packrafting, and hiking into bad drainages. I love getting
[skunked](https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/claythompson/2016/11/12/ask-clay-what-origin-expression-skunked/93598570/). I love the gamble. I love when it pays off.

Plans have changed for this year, quite a bit, and after two months of being
sick, Megan and I have decided to go different routes to the Faroe Islands later
this year. She'll be training to race with Team Bones up in Canada, and I'll be
scratching my poverty itch with my car and my boat. I'll have a bike, too,
again. I'm very excited.

With all this time to do whatever I want, I've been compiling a list of rivers
to do. The [Kalmpiopsis](/posts/2021-09-23-Chetco_Recon.html) has always been crazy magical to me, so I find myself 
thinking about rivers and access a lot. Many of the rivers I want to do are Wild
and Scenic, so I decided to come up with a slightly ambitious project inspired
by Cody Townsend's [The Fifty](https://skithefifty.com/). What if I tried to
paddle all of Oregon's [Wild and Scenic](https://www.rivers.gov/wsr-act.php)?

These rivers are beautiful, sometimes hard to access, clear and completely
untouched. The Wild and Scenic definitions mean that they are pristine and
unmolested by mines or dams, and oftentimes don't even have roads. Just go look
up pictures of the Chetco river to see what I mean.

I don't know how long this will take, but I'd like to try and track all the
rivers here. Some of them I've already done, or done partially, so this will be
informitive, if anything.
