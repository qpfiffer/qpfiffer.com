Tonight, I got drunk. At [Revolver](https://www.facebook.com/revolver.taipei).
Nice place. Friendly people, and I think I made a friend, but you never know,
Maybe he's a Gremlin or a Prole. I'm still pretty drunk now.

Other than that, today was pretty damn busy. I woke up at 6:30AM again because
Jetlag. I procrastinated a bit, then decided to visit [GuangHua Digital
Plaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guang_Hua_Digital_Plaza) and the [24-hour
bookstore.](http://www.guide.taiwan-adventures.com/2011/eslite-24-hour-bookstore/)

Had lunch at a place called Watami, some kind of crazy Egg-in-a-stone-bowl meal
that was really good and filling, although a little more pricey than the
standard. Waitress had to mix it up for me because I didn't know wtf to do with
the egg in the rice. Panic.

They were both pretty neat places, I might go back to the bookstore to get some
workbooks for practice, I'm not sure. I didn't go late enough in the day for the
plaza to be of any real interest, felt like overpriced Hong Kong-style malls to
me; It's a wonder people buy things there. Everything is regularly 10-15 dollars
over what it should be,

After the bookstore, I went to a laundromat and made a
[couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coLetbqAqEU) of
[videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t5fsVhKpEw) for the folks following
along at home. Fun times. It was hot as shit in that laundromat, I sacrificed a
lot for you gibbering gremlins.

As usual, I went to the arcade to stomp some people on the thing I'm okay at,
Street Fighter. That was uneventful. I figure I'll blow at least $100.00 at this
place before I go back stateside.

When I had my fill I went to this place called Revolver. Nice people, lot of
expats/white people. Don't get me wrong, I love the friendly Taiwanese but
sometimes I just want to talk to someone without point and saying "This,
please".

Met somebody named Jacob, had a good time, then I went and bought a sandwich
from 7-11. Time for sleep.
