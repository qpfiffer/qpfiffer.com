Notables
========

### General

* A late-year stress fracture has gotten me into Disc Golf, Row-erging

### Bikes

Last year's Krampus is now a 12-speed do-anything bike- we did a two-day
[bikepacking trip](https://www.strava.com/activities/11451175688) near our new home of Missoula and I was totally fried. I don't
ride that much anymore.

I did get the fixie out of storage and crush third at a local alleycat, so I've
really been enjoying that.

### Running

Other than a stress-fracture in October it was a good year. Ran both my races in
sandals. I had some of the best weeks of training I've had in a few years in the
middle there.

* [Broken Arrow 46k](https://www.strava.com/activities/11715247916)
* [Saddles 100 (50-miler)](https://www.strava.com/activities/12585263875)
* [Didn't get the CR for this one segment](https://www.strava.com/segments/6583480?filter=overall)

### Adventure

Solo Chetco was the stand-out highlight.

* [The Chetco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgCtjUbFFDw)
* The upper Minam river was a super fun hike in

### Skiing

~50 days of skiing last year. Most of them at Rusutsu.

Living and skiing in Japan, obviously. Doing a few light-duty tours in Missoula.

* [Skiing Mt. Yotei](https://www.strava.com/activities/10831059844)

### Climbing

Bailed off of Infinite Bliss. Thats about all the climbing I did.

### Packrafting/Kayaking

~73 days in a boat, probably more. A few unrecorded laps and random wave
sessions.

* Lots of White Salmon laps
* [Lower V](https://www.strava.com/activities/11885534250)
* Minam River
* Chetco
* Finally got on the Deadwood, which was amazing
* Finally ran Staircase on the S. Fork Payette- it was fine.
* Great packrafting round-up
* Finally got a V3 Valkyrie
* Finally got on the Rogue- it was great, very mellow
* N. Fork Blackfoot
* Got on [Slate Creek](https://www.strava.com/activities/11513734082) again
* [Wild Mile](https://www.strava.com/activities/11219646001) on the Swan
* Hiked up the middle fork of the flathead into the wilderness section
* Also did a multiday on the middle segment with Megan and Jake
* A couple smash n' grab laps on Meadwocamp, my favorite
* Got both a new Ripper 2 and a Firecracker 242.

Among many others. Didn't make it to Kyrgyzstan.

### Strength/Fitness

Now that I live somewhere I've been able to focus a lot more on strength. I was
able to complete my goal of 20 consecutirve pull-ups after doing a partial
Armstrong-program in November after my stress fracture. Yee-haw.

### Books

Lots of audiobooks because I was in the car so much- Richard K. Morgan featured
heavily. I really liked his fantasy series, and _Thin Air_ is a fave I've
listened to several times.

I didn't finish the books I wanted to in the beginning (2666, Infinite Jest) but
I'm almost done with the former. _Mao II_ was alright. I liked White Noise quite
a lot. _Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself_ was a good listen but
kind of depressing. _Gun, with Occasional Music_ was hilarious and I think of
the following line often:

> Good-looking for 50 or bad for 35.

_Fourth Wing_ and _A Court of Thorns and Roses_ both bounced off me.

_Between Two Fires_ was surprisingly good- like Catholic fan-fiction.

I've been picking at Henry Miller again, and wish I hadn't given away my copy of
_Black Spring_, even though I hate it. We have a bookshelf now, and it's
exciting to see all of our books out in the open.

All the usuals were there too: Starfish, some Void Star, Piranesi, Harrow/Gideon/Nona the
Ninth.

### Code

Not much. Some [small](https://git.sr.ht/~qpfiffer/AirplaneMan) projects of
[different kinds](https://git.sr.ht/~qpfiffer/GoPro-Browser). Random commits
here and there. I joined the American Whitewater org to contribute a little bit
at the end of the year, so thats' been fun.

Injuries
========

Well the stress-fracture has sucked, but it's really highlighted other things
and let me focus on other activities. I'm still excited to come back for 2025
and start running again. We have a hill in town, Mt. Sentinel, that is 1900 feet
up in 1.6 miles and I love it. This will be a vert-heavy year.
