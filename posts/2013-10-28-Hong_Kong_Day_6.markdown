Not too much to say about today. Mostly a worry-about-getting-through-customs
day.

* Woke up at 8-ish, had breakfast at McDonalds because I like terrible food
  early before flying.
* Packed our stuff, checked out of the hostel around 9:45 AM. No problems there.
  Turns out our room had a whole closet/safe area we didn't know about (Damn
secret doors)
* Dragged all of our stuff to the general post office in central, fired off a
  couple of postcards.
* Lounged around at the Starbucks near there for a while. Played the terrible
  MTR-themed version of Uno I bought in the lobby at our hostel.
* Headed to the airport around 1PM, I think.
* The airport was massive, which we didn't really see the first time we came
  through. Really crowded.
* Got our boarding passes, wandered around in search of food. Bought some
  no-name fried rice, Claire had some kind of curried beef brisket.
* Hiked out to our gate, which was way the hell near the end of the airport.
* Waited around until after sunset for our flight. Bought and started reading
  Dan Simmons' _The Abominable_. Pretty good so far.
* Flew for ten hours. Managed to sleep or half-sleep through most of it.
* Hung out on the US side of the Vancouver airport for about an hour and a half.
  Kind of lonely on that side.
* Quick jaunt down to Portland.
* Back home.

That pretty much concludes my trip. Next up, Singapore? Murmansk? I'll figure it
out.
