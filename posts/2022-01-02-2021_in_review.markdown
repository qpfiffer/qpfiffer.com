Notables
========

### General

* Broke up. Got back together. Again.
* Lived in my car as a dirtbag kayaker sort of in bend for a couple of months.
  Turns out I don't really like it that much to do it every day, forever.
* Learned about Vulnerability.

### Bikes

The [Tian Shan Traverse](/posts/2021-07-01-Kyrgyzstan_2021.html) in Kyrgyzstan
was obviously the highlight of the year.

* Got really dehydrated on the [Tahoe Rim Trail](https://www.instagram.com/p/CRgxasssDGT/)
* [Black Canyon Trail](https://www.strava.com/activities/4828224879)
* Some really good [fatbiking](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLKJFPFn_Iy/) on
  breakable crust.
* MTB stuff all over and too much to count.

### Running

Lots of big days early in the year to get ready for R2R2R, and a few multisport
days before the Teton Ogre. I felt pretty strong in November for Run the Rock,
too.


* [R2R2R](https://www.strava.com/activities/5022974819)
* Ran [Buckskin Gulch](https://www.strava.com/activities/4981927485) (did the
  bike shuttle, too)
* [Fifth at Run the Rock 20-miler](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWe9t31lxxL/)
* Running around in the [Petrified Wood National Park](https://www.instagram.com/p/CMYsIablofj/) was super cool.

### Adventure

* [First](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQrv6kpnE8E/) at the [24-hour Teton Ogre](https://www.strava.com/activities/5538782344) Adventure Race.
* The traveling continues:
    * Flagstaff, AZ
    * Boise, ID
    * Winthrop, WA
    * Placerville, CA
    * Kyrgyzstan
    * Grant's Pass, OR
    * Bend, OR
    * Bozeman, MT
* Did my first 24-hour push when we did this crazy packrafting loop on the
  Stehekin River. [One](https://www.strava.com/activities/5500793527),
  [Two](https://www.strava.com/activities/5500792747) and
  [Three](https://www.strava.com/activities/5500795063). The most absurd part of
  the day was driving back home. We should not have done that.

### Skiing

* Skii'd [Humphrey's Peak](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKwaSloFBng/). Sorta.
* Not much skiing other than the hut2hut trip we did at the end of the previous
  year. Did a couple of laps up Snowbowl in Flagstaff.
* In December I really hit it hard though, a few days at big sky, some days
  skinning up at the resort, four backcountry days- I'm learning a lot and
  focusing on it.

### Climbing

* Made it out to [City of Rocks](https://www.instagram.com/p/COssf6ZhOuw/) with
  M and Whitney.
* Climbed in [Joshua Tree](https://www.instagram.com/p/CNWDy_SFTmD/) but was too sketched to lead anything.
* Some good [miserable try-hard days](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWmyN4OrmPp/)
  in Red Rock.
* A handful of climbing days around Tahoe, mostly at Lover's Leap and the
  Cosumnes River Gorge. I lead a few things, super fun granite.
* M and I both lead a pretty cool
  [route](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105810911/mr-slate) in Flagstaff
  on the day I got my vaccine- super fun roof that challenged us both.
* A few good bouldering days in Priest Draw near where we were staying in Flagstaff
* Other stuff here and there- Some basalt cragging after R2R2R in Arizona, a
  weird day on a fucked up bolted crag with Nathalie right off the road near La
  Grande, a day with Jake and M on Phnatom Spires near Tahoe.

### Packrafting/Kayaking

It was a whitewater year. I finally got a real plastic kayak, learned to roll,
and spent way too many days in it. It was amazing. I can't even begin to find
all the days I was out on the water, I really should have written them down, but
it was many.

* My first[combat roll](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQCwgCKBvUV/).
* The [Pit River](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUnHHIeljfz/) #1, four laps.
  Probably one of my highlights.
* [Three laps on the Skykomish](https://www.instagram.com/p/CV_E5znvp_u/) - A
  personal goal!
* [Two laps on Beartrap Canyon](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXAQYF-tC8a/)
* [The Sandy Gorge](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVdOT77p_9N/), which was
  beautiful.
* Lots of [practice laps](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUTgu2zpmuA/) on the
  town-run of the Rogue River.
* Bailed on [Deep Creek](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUA6VTcl24T/) in PDX. Too
  much trash.
* Some [carnage](https://www.instagram.com/p/CSMsZsRHKoJ/) on the S. Fork of the
  American- there were good days but this was my idiotic solo lap.
* Getting scared and [swimming on the Sauk](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQ-Nn5wn5P4/)
* Working up to the Class III section on the [Methow River](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQZzaoihxtY/)
* Finally got on a section of the [Grand Canyon](https://www.strava.com/activities/4869648302)
* An awesome [multisport day](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLBFGWRHx9d/) on
  Fossil Creek- definitely one of the highlights of the year.
* Finally made it into part of the [Chetco River](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUWa8VSFYGN/)
* Trying to "run" [waterfalls](https://www.instagram.com/p/CMU7-GhlA27/)

### Strength/Fitness

* Not really a lot of goals here but I was consistent with the pull-ups. That
  has helped with a lot of stuff randomly.
* I really like the Moonboard for climbing training- it stresses the tendons in
  all the right ways.
* More endurance forever. My body seems to finally be adapting, not a lot of
  overuse injuries this year except for the IT band thing in December.

### Books

Not as much as I wanted, but I've started dedicating more time to books in the
evenings. I'm THIS CLOSE to finishing Black Spring, finally. I can't stand it
but I won't let it beat me.

* Tropic of Cancer - Henry Miller
* Breathe: A Life in Flow - Rickson Gracie
* The Feral Detective - Johnathan Lethem
* The Art of Resilience - Ross Edgeley
* Piranesi - Maybe my favorite book of 2021
* There is no Antimemetics Division - qntm
* The Invention of Sound - Chuck Palahniuk
* Consider Phlebas - Iain M. Banks

### Code

Who writes code anymore?

### Us

TBD.

Injuries
========

* I think I deeply injured or broke my hand or something in the San Juan Mountains- I
  crashed into a tree skiing and it took liek four months to feel normal again.
* The night before running R2R2R my knee sweeled up for some reason- this seems
  to re-occur a lot. It's for now harmless, but feels weird. I wonder if
  something is messed up in there.
* Re-sprained my back a couple of times. I really need to do some PT for it or
  something. Core helps a lot but I don't want to keep injuring it.
* Really deep bruising after solo kayak swim- Bad idea.
* Right big toe has some frostnip, I think. Normal.
* Some left IT band syndrome from not recovering enough after Run the Rock. It
  only really hurts on descents though so I'm hopeing to survive Fat Pursuit.
