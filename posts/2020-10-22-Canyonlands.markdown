This July, I decided to finally take a [Swiftwater Safety Course](https://swiftwatersafetyinstitute.com/ssi-courses/packraft-specific-training/) and up my safety game on whitewater.
The course ended up being really underwhelming, but I got to meet a few cool
people, and Eric was one of them. Eric is an aventure racer and general outdoor
enthusiast with a penchant for maps and long routes with a bit of suffering
involved. We bonded over backcountry travel, alpine-style, and kept in contact
after the class.

Fast-forward a month or so, and Eric invites me on a [canyonlands figure-8](https://backcountrypost.com/threads/canyonlands-figure-8-packrafting-loop-through-the-needles-and-maze-district.6537/) of
his own devising. The general idea is that you start somewhere in the
[Canyonlands of Utah](https://www.nps.gov/cany/index.htm), hit the
[Colorado River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River) to the confluence with the
[Green river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_River_\(Colorado_River\)),
hike up and then do it in reverse (Green -> Colorado). This is a pretty neat
trip in the backpacking/packrafting world.

We figured out dates (mid-September) and fired it off. Eric did all the
schmoozing with park rangers and logistics, and I agreed to just have a good
attitude about carrying heavy packs.

# Day 0

Prep involved five days of food, at least 4.5L of water, bags to poop into, paddling gear and
clothing. The food all had to be put into [rat sacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_River_(Colorado_River)) because apparently
rodents are a big problem on the waterway. We also had to carry a [fire pan](https://suspiciousdevices.com/)
even though a statewide fireban was in effect. The rules have since been
rewritten here, but it was annoying.

Our packs ended up being 60+ pounds, with water and food. Soul-crushing,
especially since I believe the Hyperlight Mountain Gear 4400s we were both using
tend to collapse with heavy loads.

I kept it light by only bringing one set of clothing, but three pairs of socks.
Socks are important. Don't skimp.

# Day 1

We woke up early that first day and drove out to place the car shuttle. It was
nice and cool in the evening and I listened to Dark Side of the Moon the whole
way out there. It was nice to have a whole week off to just go sleep in the
desert. We were out and walking into our first canyon just an hour or so later.

That first day was mostly getting used to the weight of the packs and descending
into slot canyons, walking on cobble-ish rocks and over soft sand and down. We
covered about 6.5 miles to the Colorado river, exploring the canyons and slowly
getting baked out by the sun, then had a glorious transition and paddled to
[Spanish Bottom](https://thetrekplanner.com/canyonlands-spanish-bottom/).

The river was low, flat and slow but it felt amazing to be in the boat instead
of carrying it.

We had enough time after getting to camp we decided to hike up and check out [the
dollhouse](https://thetrekplanner.com/canyonlands-the-dollhouse-granaries/). The
hike up was pretty steep, something like 2500 feet, but it was worth it without
packs.

After exploring for a while and failing to find the actual Granary,
we headed back down to camp and to sleep, going to bed pretty early. My notes
mention something about a "Flotilla of Scum", which was a reference to the
random collections of pond scum and foam on the river.

# Day 2

Day two was a hard day for me. We agreed to wake up at 5:30 every day just so
we'd have time to hike before the sun totally destroyed us. It was actually
really nice to get into that rhythm, it definitely set the expectation for the
day. Eric is an efficient machine at packing, and I liked to eat oatmeal, so we
usually wouldn't leave camp before 7:00 or so.

Starting the day with the same 2500 foot climb as the day before, but with our
fully loaded packs, was pretty soul-crushing. It got harder, as we ended up
covering 18 miles that day.

We started off by going to the overlook point, which was nice because we got to
ditch the packs for a while and see the river from as high up as possible.

From there we hiked down and back around, dropping briefly into Water Canyon and
then mindlessly slogging up Shot Canyon. Water was hard to find and I felt
pretty terrible most of the day. The sun was pretty brutal.

For some reason I thought getting to Chimney Rock would be some kind of relief
from the slogging in the heat, but it really just marked the midpoint of the day.
We kept slogging, eventually dropping off of the plateau and down back into [the
maze](https://www.nps.gov/cany/planyourvisit/maze.htm) itself. We spent the rest
of the day trudging slowly through soft sand. We did get to pass the gallery
though, so that was pretty cool.

We dropped camp in Horse Canyon, then found a small spring for water and trudged
back. We were absolutely destroyed and in bed by 7:45PM.

# Day 3
