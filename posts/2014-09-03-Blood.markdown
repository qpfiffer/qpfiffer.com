Well it's been two days, what have I been up to? Just a bit. As a general status
update, the scurvy has krept in a little bit, I have a ton of mosquito bites
(and I seem to get more every day) and I'm a little sunburnt. I also shaved
recently. It's still way too hot here.

Yesterday I needed to do laundry, so that was my first course of action. After
eating [this delicious soupy shit](https://www.flickr.com/photos/104820964@N07/15125264141/)
I had a powerful urge to return to base and think it over. It really didn't
agree with me for some reason, maybe it was the garlic vinegar or something.

After finally doing [some laundry](https://www.flickr.com/photos/104820964@N07/15127900602/)
I didn't know what to do, so I consulted one of the random pamhlets I pilfered
from the lobby at the hostel. [Treasure Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Hill)
and 公馆(Gongguan) in general looked pretty fun so I decided to head out there.

I haven't put the pictures up yet, but so far it's my favorite place in Taipei.
It has the feel of [Beyond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3P4a2MBssc) in the
animatrix, it's pretty crazy. Random stairways, half-houses, parts of it are
crumbling; it's awesome.

Today I went to [Beitou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beitou) which is the home
of all of the hot springs in Taipei. Really nice little hike, with some neat
pictures at the [end as a result.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/104820964@N07/14940571818/)
Being at that hot spring, not even in it, just near it, is definitely the
hottest I've been this whole trip. The thermal valley hot spring is 80-100
degrees celsius, and the water is constantly letting off sulfur/steam.

On the way back you can dip your feet into the runoff, which is a frostry 60 or
so degrees celsius. There I met two Japanese guys and a Chinese girl who were
visitng, we managed to converse somehow. We took a picture together and then
parted ways.

I wrapped the day up at this [really expensive pub](http://www.ontaptaipei.com/)
which I probably won't go back to, and now I'm back at the hostel.
