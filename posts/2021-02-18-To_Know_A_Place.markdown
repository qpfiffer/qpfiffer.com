Last September I packed everything I wanted to keep and left Portland. M left
even earlier, in May, for Bellingham. We took different channels in the
same river but ended up at the same place. We've been to Taos and Pinos Altos,
both in New Mexico. We went to Colorado for half a month. Now we're in
Flagstaff, Arizona and it's been almost seven weeks. This means I've had no
permanent home for almost six months, and her for longer.

It's weird to think that. Recently, in an anti-distractionary effort, and a vain
attempt to slow down time, I've adopted a morning hour-or-so where I just sit
and think. I'm allowed to have a pen and paper, but nothing else. You can write
or you can think, or you can sit there and do nothing. I stole this
shamelessy from Neil Gaiman, who talked about it on podcast with Tim Ferris.
I've found it to be really productive, until the coffee kicks in and I'm tossed
into a dark hole of obsession and randomness (which is actually pretty fun).

The self-reflection time is really nice, but so is just being able to sit and think
and feel what my passion is, and I've found that right now it's heavily tied to
knowing a place and exploring it and knowing what the details are. We're butted
up right against the [National Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/coconino/) here
in Mountainaire, which means I literally open a gate in the backyard and there
are miles and miles of wide-open trails, sparsely forested tundra and a ton of
[limestone boulder formations.](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105945099/priest-draw)

I had the feeling the other night as I was skinning home from a random solo
adventure that it's really nice to feel your dead-reckoning kick in and know
where you are- to know that this draw is over here, that this gully is the one I did
_blank_ in that one time, that if I walk in this direction I'll eventually come
to a road that will take me back home or farther out towards mystery.

When you start to fill in the gaps in the map in your head, a place
really comes alive. Even the little things, like knowing how to get to the
grocery store and then get home without navigation, give depth to a place. I
don't know how to explain this to people, it's one of those micro-philosophical
decisions I made a long time ago. Depth is important. Depth and confidence in
where you are.

Being anchored in place also anchors you in time, and maybe that's the whole
point.
