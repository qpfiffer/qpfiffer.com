Notables
========

### General

* Broke up. Got back together. Made some mistakes. Lots of _feelings_ this year.

* Sold all of my bikes and got rid of all my stuff and started went full nomad.
* We had a pretty interesting few weeks at the house back in March: We'd pick a
  challenge and everyone would see how much of it they could do. I think we did
  push-ups, pull-ups, bike miles, running miles, etc. It was really cool to see
  everyone get together and haul ass. A housemate of mine, Lance, really took
  off and actually started running pretty regularly as a result of the running week.
* Tried to hand-make a bed and failed. A friend of mine still has all the wood. Probably.

### Packrafting

It was a _really_ good year for paddling: I got revenge on lines that I didn't
get clean last year, and I did a lot of new, weird, manky stuff. Quite a few
days on the water. In addition:

<img src="/static/img/diypackraft.jpg" alt="diypackraft"/>

### Strength/Fitness

Not real strength goals accomplished this year, although I did do a lot of
pull-ups. Fastest mile ever is a nice one but I didn't really train for it, it
just kind of happened. More technical progression this year than fitness.

### Books

A good handful! I wish I'd read more, but I'm happy with this list.
Also a shitton of Pocket articles- I cranked through them on a
hut trip at the end of the year. I really enjoyed [Mark Twight's
writing](https://equipesolitaire.com/blogs/discourse/84506308-naked-and-savage)
this year. Kiss or kill was really good, again. It kind of fit the mood.

I still haven't read Henry Miller's <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Spring_(short_stories)">Black Spring</a>, which annoys me greatly.
It puts me to sleep or makes me mad, which I think is a pretty wonderful effect.

### Code

* Setup a [spurcehut](https://git.sr.ht/) account, which I like a lot.
* [Symlink chaff](https://git.sr.ht/~qpfiffer/fuck_this_place.sh)
* Fucked around a lot with Gentoo this year and made a [personal overlay](https://q.pfiffer.org/posts/2020-04-23-Personal_Gentoo_Overlay.html)
* A lot of work [was done](https://git.sr.ht/~qpfiffer/ThirtyEight-Moths) on
  38-Moths
* [logproj](https://git.sr.ht/~qpfiffer/logproj) had a bunch of work done on it.
  It still doesn't work but it's all server-side now, on top of 38-Moths.
* I let pdxburritoreview expire.
* Did a ton of work on [Voidcrash](https://github.com/qpfiffer/Voidcrash) in a
  random couple-week sprint. I'll wait til next year to roll more on that.
* There was [an attempt](https://github.com/qpfiffer/mgm) to build a better
  alternative to my `~/scratch` file, but I ended up just building a really
  shitty text editor and gave up. It's in C + ncurses, though!

Regrets
=======

Goals from Last Year
====================

* <span class="unsure">Unsure</span>STAY HYPE
* <span class="fail">Failed</span>Retry the bivy-a-month challenge.
    I'm getting pretty good at sleeping on the ground.
    * January: Wallowas, 1/31 - 2/1: Slept outside in a snow pit outside the
      yurt.
    * February: 2/22 - 2/23: Slept outside at the smith rock state bivy area.
      Fantastic night but the SOL emergency bivy was very damp. Ended up just
      sleeping on top of it.
    * March: Nope
    * April: Nope
    * May: Nope
    * June: Bivvied outside on the coast, near the Nestucca river. Very wet.
    * July: Bivvied near Slab Daddy approach in Darrington. Very wet. Lots of
      mosquitos. Very funny. Also in Index, near river.
    * August: Through the packrafting class, I slept at the hot springs campsite
      and again across from it on the river.
    * September: Slept in my car a lot, and next to it all over. Mostly in Joe's
      Valley, though.
    * October: Ran westwater canyon and slept in my boat. Slept on the side of
      the road on the way to New Mexico, as well. Slept on BLM land next to the
      Rio Grande. Started to get cold!
    * November: Bivvied overnight once and went for a run super early the next
      morning. Somewhere along the Rio Hondo near the Taos Ski Valley. Also
      slept along the gila river, when we went to check out the hot springs.
    * December: Banks of San Francisco River.
* <span class="fail">Failed</span>Be more proactive about body maintenance: Stretching, Rolling, Yoga, etc. I'm
  getting older and I need to mobility.
* <span class="unsure">Unsure</span>One book a month, at least. Read through all the stuff on the shelf.
    * I'm happy with the amount I read, but I didn't do a book-a-month.
* <span class="suc">Success</span>More Ice Climbing
* <span class="suc">Success</span>Get better at skiing
    * The end of the year really grabbed these two, I spent a week in the Ouray
      Ice Park and then a week skiing huts in the San Juans. I'm more confident
      in both now.
* <span class="fail">Failed</span>Climb Rainier, Helens
* <span class="suc">Success</span>Take more classes! First-aid, Crevasse rescue, Rock safety, Swiftwater, etc.
  (This one is cheating because I already signed up to a bunch of them)
    * Took mountaineering first-aid, my AIARE avy-1 course and my swiftwater
      safety course. The swiftwater course was kinda lame though.
* <span class="unsure">Unsure</span>Move every day.
* <span class="fail">Failed</span>Work on making new and varied friends: Human relationships are valuable.
    * Covid kind of fucked this one up.
* <span class="unsure">Unsure</span>Cross some items off the BS Adventure calendar
* <span class="suc">Success</span>Do one of [these runs](http://www.christofteuscher.com/aagaa/run-outside-the-box/)
    * I ended up running [Dog Mountain six times over night.](https://www.strava.com/activities/3981927934)
* <span class="suc">Success</span>More sewing projects!
    * The only thing I made (I think?) is a bag for my climbing rope.

Injuries
========

Actually not too bad this year, except that I can't really deadlift anymore. I
pulled my left spinal erector twice doing it in the driveway earlier in the year
and I'm cautious now. Feels like it's a chronic thing and probably related to
the sciatica.

* Fun infection stuff that took forever to clear up
* There was a pretty vicious quad-pull that took forever to heal. That was no fun. It happened as a result of [this run](https://www.strava.com/activities/3256452382) where I went around in a circle 20 times or something.
* Random sciatica from working in the back of my car, on stools, sitting on the
  floor, etc.
* Lots of new scrapes and bumps and gouges. I took a big chunk of skin out of my
  shin after climbing one day in Moab.
