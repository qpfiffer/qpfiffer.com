Lot's of turmoil this year, good and bad things. I feel like I'm a better person
than I was last year.

Accomplishments
===============

* Driver's License + Car (Wooo!)
* Gained ~20 pounds (135 -> 155)
* I'm in the best shape of my life
* Got two bikes stolen, one was recovered. Learned my lesson there.
* Met a lot of new people
* Travelled to New York to see family with just my brother
* New Tattoos
* Hiked quite a bit
* Started doing daily journalling to cope with memory loss. This has improved my
  hand-writing and memory.

* [Helped build](https://twitter.com/corporatesans/status/653452235158872064)
  and then [camped in](https://www.flickr.com/photos/104820964@N07/23783937410/in/datetaken-public/) a dome in the Alvord Desert.

* Started rock climbing, made it out to smith rock.
* Passed CHN202
* Camped out in a dome on the river with some friends
* Hosted a Tuesday-night singlespeed-only ride for a while
* Rode around Portland more than any other year. Met a lot of cool people via
  bikescum groups.
* Sort of learned to cook. I can make some pretty mean chicken breast in the
  oven now.

Side-Projects
=============

### Succeeded (for some definitions of the word)
* [Skulledit](https://github.com/qpfiffer/skulledit) - Random project in Love2D
  that I wheedle on every now and then to [implement the skullcode hex editor.](http://skullcode.com/)
* [38-Moths](https://github.com/qpfiffer/38-Moths) - Split waifu.xyz into a
  framework in C. Actually pretty cool, reasonably fast and easy to use. Pretty proud
  of this one, actually.
* [Printer Facts API](https://github.com/qpfiffer/Printer-Facts-API) - Uses the
  38-Moths framework to serve Printer facts at Webscale speeds.
* [Simple Sparsehash](https://github.com/qpfiffer/Simple-Sparsehash) - A
  re-implementation of Google's sparsehash, got me a little internet fame and
  was a really good learning opportunity.
* [Clear Waste of Time](https://github.com/infoforcefeed/Clear-Waste-of-Time) -
  Random, tiny IRC-spawned ideas. Kind of a fun collection of stupid shit.
* [Mayo-Workbench](https://github.com/infoforcefeed/mayo-workbench) - Uses
  38-Moths to display information about an OlegDB instance.

### Continued (Not dead yet!)
* [Lair](https://github.com/qpfiffer/lair) - Still kicking, some how. Started
  working on it again. Some [people are excited.](https://github.com/qpfiffer/lair/commit/1b8699a7d63df7545c34320b8f17c37a64d9a40b)
* [#metaforcefeed](https://github.com/qpfiffer/metaforcefeed) - Still chugging
  along even after the huge data failure. It now handles events and some
  RSVP-like capabilities.
* [shithouse.tv](https://github.com/qpfiffer/shithouse.tv) - Still one of my
  more popular things, had quite a few PR's from [my favorite person](https://github.com/dequis) and a few new features.
* [merveilles.io](https://github.com/qpfiffer/merveilles_io) - Still kicking
  along since 2013, haven't really had to touch it. You can see the [one remaining instance here.](http://infoforcefeed.shithouse.tv/)

### Limbo
* [OlegDB](https://olegdb.org/) - Didn't really touch it this year, a weird
  segfault in `olt_spoil` kind of defeated me.
* [waifu.xyz](https://github.com/qpfiffer/waifu.xyz) - Defeated after numerous
  segfaults, hosting costs and random shit. Decided to shelve it for the time being.
* [voidcrash](https://github.com/qpfiffer/Voidcrash) - I don't even know. No
  explicit goal or timeframe, mostly just mythos/world building with a friend of mine.

### Failed
* [zx](https://github.com/qpfiffer/zx) - Was going to use this as a time
  tracking utility but stopped caring pretty quickly.
* [PrinterFS](https://github.com/infoforcefeed/PrinterFS) - Was going to be a
  distributed file system. Ended up being too complicated.
* [PrintlessFS](https://github.com/qpfiffer/PrintlessFS) - Was going to use
  this as FUSE bindings to rethinkdb for waifu. Overwhelmed and under-motivated.
* [Thray](https://github.com/infoforcefeed/thray) - Was going to be an exercise
  with a friend of mine to scrape tumblr. Got distracted and started working on
  other things. Wrote some C++ that hits the tumble endpoints, though.

Regrets
=======

* I spent way too much money on cassette tapes
* I haven't created as much as I wanted to
* Hurt some people.
* Didn't work on OlegDB much at all this year.
* Failed CHN203
* waifu.xyz kind of stopped being a thing. Currently in Limbo. I put a lot of
  effort into it last year. Sucks to see it languishing.
* Didn't leave the country this year
* Didn't write as much code as I wanted to
* Slept too much
