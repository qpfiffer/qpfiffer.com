Accomplishments
===============

* Passed Chinese 101, 102, 103 and 201 with flying colors. Helped start and
  maintain the [PCC Chinese Club.](http://chinesepcc.club/) Met a lot of cool
  people in chinese class. Good year for language learning.
* Spent almost a month in Taiwan, alone. One of my most valuablea experiences of
  2014.
* Wrote more C this year than any other time. Ever.
* Wrote some Erlang. Nice language, don't like the VM.
* Put a [ton of work](https://github.com/infoforcefeed/OlegDB/commits?author=qpfiffer)
  into [OlegDB](https://olegdb.org/). Ended up creating
  [GRESHUNKEL](https://github.com/infoforcefeed/OlegDB-Website/tree/master/greshunkel)
  to build and power the website, which has now infected many of my other projects.
* Attempted to [implement a language, Den.](https://github.com/qpfiffer/lair)
  Turns out I hate parsing things.
* Took the Xbox-live syntax from the GRESHUNKEL static generator, ported it to C
  and released it as a [stand-alone library.](https://github.com/qpfiffer/gshkl)
* Had a handful of people break my IRC link aggregators:
    - ["Bruteforcing the Devil"](https://blog.passcod.name/2014/jun/05/bruteforcing-the-devil)
    - A guy named Bearst sent in some security patches regarding CSRF, Oleg.
      Thanks, Bearst!
* Wrote a handful of C++, got a recruiting email from Google for it. Neat.
* Okay year for book reading, I wish I'd read more books. Taiwan was great for
  reading.

  Played a lot this year.

* Took too many [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/104820964@N07/) to easily count.

Side-Projects
=============

### Succeeded (for some definitions of the word)
* [OlegDB](https://olegdb.org/) - I don't care what you say, best thing of 2014.
* [waifu.xyz](https://github.com/qpfiffer/waifu.xyz) - Somehow spent enough time
  on this to have almost 300 commits. It's a webserver, templating language,
  webm-scraping, OlegDB-testing megamachine that basically downloads porn from
  4chan and displays them on a single-page. Hilarious. Works really well for
  what it is, still needs some love. I'm really happy with this project.
* [GRESHUNKEL](https://github.com/infoforcefeed/OlegDB-Website) - The static
  site generator that I will use for the rest of my life. Hilariously awful,
  it's probably the first thing utilizing antagonistic design principals.
* [BashDB](https://github.com/qpfiffer/BashDB) - Mostly a joke, just to see if I
  could.
* [DBM Source Code](https://github.com/qpfiffer/Unix-v7-DBM) - Not really a
  sideproject, I just dug up the old v7 DBM code and put it online because I got
  tired of wondering what it looked like.
* [IRC-Nick-Graph](https://github.com/qpfiffer/IRC-Nick-Graph) - C++ project I
  spent a couple of weekends on to build a graph of Usernames -> Aliases from
  IRC logs. Started after I read the User -> Role permission graph in the
  MongoDB sourcecode. Works pretty well. Don't really need to touch it again.
* [chinesepcc.club](https://github.com/qpfiffer/chinesepcc.club) - Website for
  the Chinese PCC Club. Built with Greshunkel. Works well.
* [gshkl](https://github.com/qpfiffer/gshkl) - C port of the greshunkel
  templating language.

### Limbo
* [lair](https://github.com/qpfiffer/lair) - My interpreter for the Den
  language. Turns out I hate making languages.
* [#metaforcefeed](https://github.com/qpfiffer/metaforcefeed) - Originally a
  generic Reddit-like system to track ideas and test OlegDB. It's currently
  broken because Oleg did something weird to it's datafiles and I haven't reverse
  engineered it yet.
* [shithouse.tv](https://github.com/qpfiffer/shithouse.tv) - Probably my most
  popular project of 2014. Just puts images on a page with a background color.
  Needs some love to support tags and webms.
* [mttp](https://github.com/qpfiffer/mttp) - The HTTP server that powered OlegDB
  before we switched to Go. It doesn't compile right now but I didn't want to
  lose the code. May use it again someday.

### Failed
* [waifu.coffee](https://github.com/qpfiffer/waifu.coffee) - Was going to be a
  reverse-image search engine thing. Ended up getting mired in the image format
  bullshit (Do I write my own jpeg parser? What about PNGs?). I might get back
  to it someday.
* [kyoto-pantry](https://github.com/qpfiffer/kyotopantry) - Userspace file
  deduplication. Got mired in the actual implementation of min-hashing and
  efficient chunk differentiation. Dunno if I ever want to finish this one.
* [agdyne](https://github.com/qpfiffer/agdyne) - Evolved from the IRC-Nick-Graph
  project, was going to be a graph database. Didn't go far, got fed-up with
  needing to build a query language.


Regrets
=======

* Didn't write much Haskell this year.
* Didn't box much at all this year. Really regret this one, it was my favorite

  last year.
