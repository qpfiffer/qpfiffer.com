Accomplishments
===============

* Passed Chinese 101, 102, 103 and 201 with flying colors. Helped start and
  maintain the [PCC Chinese Club.](http://chinesepcc.club/) Met a lot of cool
  people in chinese class. Good year for language learning.
* Spent almost a month in Taiwan, alone. One of my most valuable experiences of
  2014.
* Wrote more C this year than any other time. Ever.
* Wrote some Erlang. Nice language, don't like the VM.
* Put a [ton of work](https://github.com/infoforcefeed/OlegDB/commits?author=qpfiffer)
  into [OlegDB](https://olegdb.org/). Ended up creating
  [GRESHUNKEL](https://github.com/infoforcefeed/OlegDB-Website/tree/master/greshunkel)
  to build and power the website, which has now infected many of my other projects.
* Attempted to [implement a language, Den.](https://github.com/qpfiffer/lair)
  Turns out I hate parsing things.
* Took the Xbox-live syntax from the GRESHUNKEL static generator, ported it to C
  and released it as a [stand-alone library.](https://github.com/qpfiffer/gshkl)
* Had a handful of people break my IRC link aggregators:
    - ["Bruteforcing the Devil"](https://blog.passcod.name/2014/jun/05/bruteforcing-the-devil)
    - A guy named Bearst sent in some security patches regarding CSRF, Oleg.
      Thanks, Bearst!
* Wrote a handful of C++, got a recruiting email from Google for it. Neat.
* Okay year for book reading, I wish I'd read more books. Taiwan was great for
  reading.

  Played a lot this year.

* Quit my job, started freelancing for some [cool people.](http://survantjames.com/)

* Took too many [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/104820964@N07/) to easily count.

Side-Projects
=============

### Succeeded (for some definitions of the word)
* [OlegDB](https://olegdb.org/) - I don't care what you say, best thing of 2014.
* [waifu.xyz](https://github.com/qpfiffer/waifu.xyz) - Somehow spent enough time
  on this to have almost 300 commits. It's a webserver, templating language,
  webm-scraping, OlegDB-testing megamachine that basically downloads webms from
  4chan and does some basic analysis on them. Hilarious. Works really well for
  what it is, still needs some love. I'm really happy with this project.
* [GRESHUNKEL](https://github.com/infoforcefeed/OlegDB-Website) - The static
  site generator that I will use for the rest of my life. Hilariously awful,
  it's probably the first thing utilizing antagonistic design principals.
* [BashDB](https://github.com/qpfiffer/BashDB) - Mostly a joke, just to see if I
  could.
* [DBM Source Code](https://github.com/qpfiffer/Unix-v7-DBM) - Not really a
  sideproject, I just dug up the old v7 DBM code and put it online because I got
  tired of wondering what it looked like.
* [IRC-Nick-Graph](https://github.com/qpfiffer/IRC-Nick-Graph) - C++ project I
  spent a couple of weekends on to build a graph of Usernames -> Aliases from
  IRC logs. Started after I read the User -> Role permission graph in the
  MongoDB sourcecode. Works pretty well. Don't really need to touch it again.
* [chinesepcc.club](https://github.com/qpfiffer/chinesepcc.club) - Website for
  the Chinese PCC Club. Built with Greshunkel. Works well.
* [gshkl](https://github.com/qpfiffer/gshkl) - C port of the greshunkel
  templating language.

### Limbo
* [lair](https://github.com/qpfiffer/lair) - My interpreter for the Den
  language. Turns out I hate making languages.
* [#metaforcefeed](https://github.com/qpfiffer/metaforcefeed) - Originally a
  generic Reddit-like system to track ideas and test OlegDB. It's currently
  broken because Oleg did something weird to it's datafiles and I haven't reverse
  engineered it yet.
* [shithouse.tv](https://github.com/qpfiffer/shithouse.tv) - Probably my most
  popular project of 2014. Just puts images on a page with a background color.
  Needs some love to support tags and webms.
* [mttp](https://github.com/qpfiffer/mttp) - The HTTP server that powered OlegDB
  before we switched to Go. It doesn't compile right now but I didn't want to
  lose the code. May use it again someday.

### Failed
* [waifu.coffee](https://github.com/qpfiffer/waifu.coffee) - Was going to be a
  reverse-image search engine thing. Ended up getting mired in the image format
  bullshit (Do I write my own jpeg parser? What about PNGs?). I might get back
  to it someday.
* [kyoto-pantry](https://github.com/qpfiffer/kyotopantry) - Userspace file
  deduplication. Got mired in the actual implementation of min-hashing and
  efficient chunk differentiation. Dunno if I ever want to finish this one.
* [agdyne](https://github.com/qpfiffer/agdyne) - Evolved from the IRC-Nick-Graph
  project, was going to be a graph database. Didn't go far, got fed-up with
  needing to build a query language.


Regrets
=======

* Didn't write much Haskell this year.
* Didn't box much at all this year. Really regret this one, it was my favorite

  last year.
