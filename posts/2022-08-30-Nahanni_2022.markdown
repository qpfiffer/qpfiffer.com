So it finally happened. This year, after several years of set-backs and
showstoppers, it finally happened: The logistics gods all aligned and we were
able to put together a one-in-a-lifetime river trip down the South Nahanni. I
won't go into the background about why this place is so special, but I encourage
you to read our [primary inspiration](http://tom.grundy.tripod.com/basedir/nahanni.html)
and to check out what [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Nahanni_River) 
has to say about the Nahanni.

To start with, it's a seldom-visited, storied destination with some rather <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Falls_(Northwest_Territories)">rather
famous landmarks.</a> The whitewater isn't really anything to worry about since
it's primarily a canoe trip destination, but it was still something to think about.

In addition, one of the [50 classic climbs of north america](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifty_Classic_Climbs_of_North_America)
is right along the river, the famed [Lotus Flower Tower.](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105905652/lotus-flower-tower) M has
had her on this objective for a really long time, and it's a phenomonal
multisport trip: Paddle for a while, climb for a while, paddle out. The route's
difficulty is supposedly in the range of us mere mortals, too, so the trip
needed to happen. It's perfect!

# Training, Logistics and Testing

## Logistics

I think this trip had more logistics to solve than any other trip I've done.
Just look at the numbers:

* Permits to buy for six people
* Shuttles for six people (10 hours of driving from the take-out to the put-in)
* 25 hours of driving just to get up to the take-out from Portland
* Food for 22-25 days
* A plane to shuttle in our climbing gear and additional food
* The logistics of the climb itself
